*Checkout the code and try out the API's*

You can check out the code for the API partitioning from the following repository {{{ git://github.com/coralcea/bigbluebutton.git }}} and here are the steps to checkout the code:

 # Create a directory to check out your code there, such as "/bigbluebutton_api/".
 # Run command `git init` to initialize the directory as a local git repository.
 # Clone the main repository {{{ git://github.com/coralcea/bigbluebutton.git }}} by using the command `git clone git://github.com/coralcea/bigbluebutton.git`.
 

After checking out the code, follow the steps for building and deploying the different pieces that are related to the API and here is how: 

 # bigbluebutton-client part, follow the instructions on how to build and run the client code as described on the [DevelopingBBB] page at [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/DevelopingBBB#Working_on_the_Client_side here]
 # bbb-common-message, follow the instructions on the the [DevelopingBBB] page [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/DevelopingBBB#BigBlueButton_Commons_Libraries here] to build and resolve dependencies (i.e copy required .jar files for BBB).
 # bigbluebutton-apps, follow the instructions on how to build and run the client code as described on the [DevelopingBBB] page [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/DevelopingBBB#BigBlueButton_Apps here]
 # bigbluebutton-web, follow the instructions on how to build and run the client code as described on the [DevelopingBBB] page  [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/DevelopingBBB#BigBlueButton_Web here]


*How to try out the code*

Here are the available API calls so far:

 * Before starting anything you have to create a meeting room by calling the "create" API call. This should bring up the Bigbluebutton Demo page (see below), then you can log in.

  * After logging in the Bigbluebutton client will load all the Bigbluebutton modules but  only 2 frames will be shown (Listeners and Viewers)(See image below). The rest of the modules (i.e. Chat, Presentation, Video, and Voice) are not started until a command is sent to start or stop.

   * You can start and stop the chat module for the Bigbluebutton within the Bigbluebutton client canvas so far (we are aiming to load each module in its own frame independently)
 
   * To start Chat Module use (see image for Chat module started only) 
{{{http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/bigbluebutton/api/moduleCmd?meetingID=Demo+Meeting&module=ChatModule&cmd=start}}}

<img src="http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bbb-images/API_PART/BBB-API-Chat Module started.jpg" />

   * To stop Chat Module use
{{{http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/bigbluebutton/api/moduleCmd?meetingID=Demo+Meeting&module=ChatModule&cmd=stop}}}

 * You can load up, start and stop the presentation module for the Bigbluebutton within the Bigbluebutton client canvas so far (the same goes for aiming to load independently) 
  
    * To start Presentation Module use (see image for Presentation module started only)
{{{http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/bigbluebutton/api/moduleCmd?meetingID=Demo+Meeting&module=PresentModule&cmd=start }}}

<img src="http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bbb-images/API_PART/BBB-API-Presentaion Module started.jpg" /> 

    * To stop Presentation Module use
{{{http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/bigbluebutton/api/moduleCmd?meetingID=Demo+Meeting&module=PresentModule&cmd=stop }}}

   * To start Voice Module use
{{{http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/bigbluebutton/api/moduleCmd?meetingID=Demo+Meeting&module=dummy&cmd=init_voice}}} , then you can click the "Headset" button to join or leave a voice conference.

   * To start Video Module use
{{{http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/bigbluebutton/api/moduleCmd?meetingID=Demo+Meeting&module=dummy&cmd=init_video}}} , the click on the "Camera" button to start your video.

   * All Modules wildcard API Call(s): To make the call for starting or stop all the module use the command 

{{{http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/bigbluebutton/api/moduleCmd?meetingID=Demo+Meeting&module=All&cmd=<start/stop> }}}  


To try out the API calls follow these steps:

 # Start you Bigbluebutton server. 
 # Call the Bigbluebbutton welcome page (i.e. http://YOUR_IP/), Bigbluebutton welcome page should come up with only Listers and Viewers windows.
 # Open another browser window and paste the link associated with the action you want (i.e. start chat, stop chat, etc) basically we are sending an HTTP POST to call the method.
