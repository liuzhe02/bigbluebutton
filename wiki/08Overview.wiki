= Introduction =

This page contains screen shots of what's new in BigBlueButton 0.8

== Record and Playback ==
See this [http://www.youtube.com/user/bigbluebuttonshare#p/a/u/1/4b_tC1JEX1E video overview] for an introduction of the new record and playback capabilities.


== Audio Settings Dialog ==

Clicking on the headset icon will now display an Audio Settings dialog to enable the user to 
  
  # verify they can hear audio through their headset
  # adjust the sensitivity of their headset's microphone

The following image shows the sequence of steps from when the user clicks the headset icon.

== Video Dock ==

By default a webcam will now appear within the Video Dock module, a new window that let's users easily arrange a set of remote webcams on their desk.

For example, they can arrange them vertically

or horizontally.

== Push To Talk ==
As discussed in the [http://groups.google.com/group/bigbluebutton-dev/browse_thread/thread/03965da6cbbc2f14 bigbluebutton-dev mailing list], BigBlueButton 0.8-beta-3 adds a 'push to talk' button to enable students to un-mute themselves and ask questions during the session.

For control, moderators can disable a student's ability to talk/mute themselves by clicking the 'lock' icon next to the student's name.  When locked, the student's 'push to talk' button disappears.
