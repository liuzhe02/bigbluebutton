#summary How to install  BigBlueButton 0.8-beta on Ubuntu in under 30 minutes

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

= Welcome =

We're pleased to announce the release !BigBlueButton 0.8 beta. 

Our goal since the beginning of the !BigBlueButton project has been to integrate record and playback into the core.   In the release of 0.8, you can now record and playback slides, audio, and chat within !BigBlueButton.  For a detailed list of changes, see [ReleaseNotes 0.8 release notes].

== Getting help and bug reporting ==

If you have any problems not answered by this document, or you have questions/feedback, please post to [http://groups.google.com/group/bigbluebutton-setup/topics?gvc=2 bigbluebutton-setup].

If you encounter a bug -- good on you mate!  Let us know (see  You can see our [IssuesInstructions process for reporting bugs]) so we can triage and fix it.  


= Before you install =

These instructions require you install !BigBlueButton 0.8 on a Ubuntu 10.04 32-bit or 64-bit server (or desktop).  We've not tested the installation on earlier or later versions of Ubuntu.

We recommend installing !BigBlueButton on a dedicated (non-virtual) server for optimal performance.  To install !BigBlueButton, you'll need root access to a Ubuntu 10.04 server with

  # 2 GB of memory (or more)
  # Dual-core 2.6 GHZ CPU (or faster)
  # Ports 80, 1935, 9123 accessible 
  # Port 80 is available and not used by another application
  # 200G of free disk space (or more) for recordings

= Video Instructions =
The following video will walk you through the installation of !BigBlueButton 0.8.

<wiki:video url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_rYw82-9Bs" width=853 height=500/>

We recommend you following the video with these step-by-step instructions below.

= Step-by-step installation =

== 1. Add the !BigBlueButton repository and ensure your server is up-to-date  == 

You first need to give your server access to the !BigBlueButton package repository for 0.8.

In a terminal window, copy and paste the following commands.

{{{
# Add the BigBlueButton key
wget http://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/bigbluebutton.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -

# Add the BigBlueButton repository URL and ensure the multiverse is enabled
echo "deb http://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/XXX/ bigbluebutton-lucid main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bigbluebutton.list
echo "deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ lucid multiverse" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list

}}}

After you've made the above changes, do a dist-upgrade to ensure your running the latest packages and your server is up-to-date before installing !BigBlueButton.

{{{
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

}}}

If you've not updated in a while, apt may recommend you reboot your server; reboot and proceed to the next step.

== 2. Install the latest version of Ruby == 

The record and playback infrastructure uses Ruby for the processing of recorded sessions.  The following script will install Ruby 1.9.2 as a package (so it can be removed later on if desired).

Copy the script below to a file called `install-ruby.sh`.

{{{
sudo apt-get -y install zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libreadline5-dev libyaml-dev build-essential bison checkinstall libffi5
cd /tmp
wget http://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.9/ruby-1.9.2-p290.tar.gz
tar xvzf ruby-1.9.2-p290.tar.gz
cd ruby-1.9.2-p290
./configure --prefix=/usr\
            --program-suffix=1.9.2\
            --with-ruby-version=1.9.2\
            --disable-install-doc
make
sudo checkinstall -D -y\
                  --fstrans=no\
                  --nodoc\
                  --pkgname='ruby1.9.2'\
                  --pkgversion='1.9.2-p290'\
                  --provides='ruby'\
                  --requires='libc6,libffi5,libgdbm3,libncurses5,libreadline5,openssl,libyaml-0-2,zlib1g'\
                  --maintainer=brendan.ribera@gmail.com
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/ruby ruby /usr/bin/ruby1.9.2 500\
                        --slave   /usr/bin/ri   ri   /usr/bin/ri1.9.2\
                        --slave   /usr/bin/irb  irb  /usr/bin/irb1.9.2\
                        --slave   /usr/bin/gem  gem  /usr/bin/gem1.9.2\
                        --slave   /usr/bin/erb  erb  /usr/bin/erb1.9.2\
                        --slave   /usr/bin/rdoc rdoc /usr/bin/rdoc1.9.2

}}}

Next, run the script

{{{
chmod +x install-ruby.sh
./install-ruby.sh
}}}

After the install finishes, type `ruby -v`.  You should see the ruby interpreter output `1.9.2p290` (or later). 

{{{
$ ruby -v
ruby 1.9.2p290 (2011-07-09 revision 32553)
}}}

Next type `gem -v`.
{{{
$ gem -v
1.3.7
}}}

Both the above commands must execute without errors before continuing with these instructions.

You might be wondering why not use the default Ruby packages for Ubumtu 10.04?  Unfortunately, they are out of date.  Thanks to [http://threebrothers.org/brendan/blog/ruby-1-9-2-on-ubuntu-11-04/ Brendan Ribera] for the above script for installing the latest ruby on Ubuntu 10.04 as a package.

== 3.  Install FreeSWITCH Configuration == 
We're now into the installation of !BigblueButton.  The !BigBlueButton makes it easy to install.

{{{
  sudo apt-get install bbb-freeswitch-config
}}}

!BigBlueButton FreeSWITCH for voice conferencing, which gives you the option setup dial-in phone numbers to your !BigBlueButton server.  


== 4.  Install !BigBlueButton == 

We're now ready to install !BigBlueButton. 

{{{
   sudo apt-get install bigbluebutton
}}}


This single command is where all the magic happens.  This command installs *all* of !BigBlueButton components with their dependencies.  Here's a screen shot of the packages it will install. 

http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bbb-images/install_ubuntu_08/apt-get-install.png

Type 'y' and press Enter.  Then sit back.  The packaging will do all the work for you to install and configure your !BigBlueButton server.

== 5. Install API Demos ==

To interactively test your !BigBlueButton server, you can install a set of API demos.  

{{{
   sudo apt-get install bbb-demo
}}}

These are the same API demos that are available off of the [http://demo.bigbluebutton.org/ BigBlueButton demo server].


== 6. Do a Clean Restart == 

To ensure !BigBlueButton has started cleanly, enter the following commands:

{{{
   sudo bbb-conf --clean
   sudo bbb-conf --check
}}}

The output from `sudo bbb-conf --check` will display your current settings and, after the text, "** Potential problems described below **", print any configuration or startup problems it has detected.  Normally, there is no text following this message.

Note: For the beta, you see the following warning

{{{
** Potential problems described below **
# The following properties in /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/bigbluebutton/WEB-INF/classes/bigbluebutton.properties have no value.
#     bigbluebutton.web.logoutURL
}}}

which can be safely ignored.


= Trying out your server (24:42 minutes later) =

You've got a full !BigBlueButton server up and running (don't you just love the power of Ubuntu/Debian packages). Open a web browser to the URL of your server.  You should see the !BigBlueButton welcome screen.

http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bbb-images/install_ubuntu_08/welcome.png

To start using your !BigBlueButton server, enter your name and click the 'Join' button.  You'll join the Demo Meeting.

http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bbb-images/install_ubuntu_08/running.png

If this is your first time using !BigBlueButton, take a moment and watch these [http://bigbluebutton.org/content/videos overview videos].

To record a session, click 'API Demos' on the welcome page and choose 'Record'.  Start a meeting and upload slides.  When you are done, click 'Logout' and return to the 'API Demos' and the record demo.  Wait a few moments and refresh your browser, you should see your recording appear.

http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bbb-images/install_ubuntu_08/record.png

Click 'Slides' to playback the slides, audio, and chat of the recording.

http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bbb-images/install_ubuntu_08/playback.png

The following [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b_tC1JEX1E YouTube Video] will walk you through using record and playback.

If you want to use !BigBlueButton with a [http://bigbluebutton.org/support 3rd party integration], you can get the URL and security salt from your server using the command `bbb-conf --salt`.

{{{
$ bbb-conf --salt

       URL: http://192.168.0.36/bigbluebutton/
      Salt: b22e37979cf3587dd616fa0a4e6228
}}}

We hope you enjoy using !BigBlueButton and welcome your feedback!

== Dependencies are not met ==

For some VPS installations of Ubuntu 10.04, the hosting provider does not give a full `/etc/apt/source.list`.  If you are finding your are unable to install a package, try replacing your `/etc/apt/sources.list` with the following

}}}

then do

{{{ 
   sudo apt-get update
}}}

and try installing !BigBlueButton again.

== Run bbb-conf ==
We've built in a !BigBlueButton configuration utility, called `bbb-conf`, to help you configure your !BigBlueButton server and trouble shoot your setup if something doesn't work right.

If you think something isn't working correctly, the first step is enter the following command.

{{{
   bbb-conf --check
}}}

This will check your setup to ensure the correct processes are running, the !BigBlueButton components have correctly started, and look for common configuration problems that might prevent !BigBlueButton from working properly.  For example, here's the output on one of our internal servers:

http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bbb-images/vm/71check.png


If you see text after the line `** Potential problems described below **`, then `bbb-conf` detected something wrong with your setup.

== Change the !BigBlueButton Server's IP ==

A common problem is the default install scripts in for !BigBlueButton configure it to list for an IP address, but if you are accessing your server via a DNS hostname, you'll see the 'Welcome to Nginx' message.

To change all of !BigBlueButton's configuration files to use a different IP address or hostname, enter

{{{
   bbb-conf --setip <ip_address_or_hostname>
}}}

For more information see [BBBConf bbb-conf options]. 

== Address already in use ==

If you have apache2 already running on the server, you'll likely see the following error messages from nginx when it starts.

{{{
Restarting nginx: [emerg]: bind() to 0.0.0.0:80 failed (98: Address
already in use)
}}}

If you see these errors, it means that nginx is unable to bind to port 80 on the local server.  To find out what's binding to port 80, do the following

{{{
   sudo apt-get install lsof
   lsof -i :80
}}}

If you see apache2 listed, then stop apache2 and start nginx

{{{
   sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 stop
   sudo /etc/init.d/nginx start
}}}
