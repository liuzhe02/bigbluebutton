The goals for the new architecture are:

  * Core should focus on collaborative technologies (not just about voice)
    * Towards this end, need stable voice first (migration to SIP at endpoints), then stable video
  * Core should be extensible through plugins
    * Plugin architecture about more than APIs (eg administration, deployment, versioning, sandboxing)
    * Initial guidance on plugins should come from opportunities
  * Core should support different UI delivery mechanisms (such as Flash and HTML5)
    * Emergent market for BigBlueButton on pads
 
The architecture should guide design decisions and provide design rationale:

  * Share architecture evolution documents with council members
  * Area contributors will be asked to contribute to the architecture evolution document
  * Target is to produce a draft of the architecture evolution document by Feb 15
