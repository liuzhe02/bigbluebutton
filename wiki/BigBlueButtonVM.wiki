  # While it's downloading, grab some popcorn and WATCH THIS VIDEO: [http://bigbluebutton.org/sites/all/videos/bbb-vm/index.html how-to video for setting up a BigBluebutton VM]. (10 minutes)
  # Follow the instructions below.

== Background ==

Many universities and colleges have told us they wanted to run their own version  !BigBlueButton behind their firewall.  In addition, our developers have asked us for ways to shorten the edit-compile-check cycle when extending  !BigBlueButton.

In response to these requests, we've created a Ubuntu-based virtual machine (VM) that makes it easy for anyone to download and run a  !BigBlueButton server.  The VM runs under VMWare Player, which is available on Unix, Windows, or Mac. This VM is also a full command-line development environment -- it's preconfigured to check out code from  !BigBlueButton Google Code repository, make local changes, and, with a single command, re-compile the code and see it run in your VM.
  
Prerequisites:
  * VMWare Player (or VMWare Workstation) for Windows or Unix, or VM Fusion for Mac
  * VMWare Fusion for Mac
  * Ability for the VM to acquire an IP address through DHCP on boot

== Setup ==

  1.  If you haven't already done so, download and uncompress the latest [http://bigbluebutton.org/downloads/bigbluebutton-vm.zip bigbluebutton-vm.zip]

  2.  Uncompress bigbluebutton-vm.zip and open the enclosed *ubuntu-vmw6* folder.

  3.  Double-click on the bigbluebutton-vm.vmx icon.  

This will start VMWare Player (or VMWare Workstation) and boot the VM. 

In VMWare, make sure the networking is set to Bridged, not NAT.  

The  !BigBlueButton VM takes about 10 minutes to first initialize.  Sit back, relax, go watch some youtube videos (or watch [http://bigbluebutton.org/sites/all/videos/bbb-vm/index.html Setting up a BigBluebutton VM]).  During this time, the  !BigBlueButton VM goes through an initial startup script that 

  * Installs a software timer for Asterisk (this allows to connect using the VoIP phone built into the  !BigBlueButton client)
  * Installs the  !BigBlueButton packages
  * Configures  !BigBlueButton to use the VM's current IP address
  * Installs OpenSSH

When it's done, you'll see a message that asks you to login and change the password.

http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bbb-images/vm/vm_boot.png

The VM has a default account called *firstuser*, with password *default*.  To secure your server, take a moment to login as firstuser (you'll need to enter the password _twice_ -- once to login, and immediately again to reset it to a different password.  Do this as it will secure your server.  

After resetting the default password, you'll get the following welcome message (this appears each time you login as firstuser)..

== Running BigBlueButton ==

At this point, you've got a full  !BigBlueButton server up and running.  Open a web browser to the URL provided in the login message for first user.

Click the Join button and you'll be prompted to join the default conference 85115.  Enter whatever name you like and then *mp* for moderator password, or *ap* for attendee password.

== Updating the  !BigBlueButton VM == 

All the  !BigBlueButton components are installed as Ubuntu packages.  These packages are available from the remote repository http://archive.bigbluebutton.org.  We updated these packages with every release.

When a release occurs, to update the VM with the latest components, do the following.

Login as firstuser (using your password of course!) and enter the following commands:
{{{
  # apt-get update
  # apt-get dist-upgrade
}}}

http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bbb-images/vm/vm-apt-get-upgrade.png

Note: If you want to live on the edge and use the latest packages built by our [http://bigbluebutton.org/hudson continuous integration server] from the head of the  !BigBlueButton Google Code repository, then edit `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/bigbluebutton.list` and change

{{{
#
# Repository for BigBlueButton
#
deb http://archive.bigbluebutton.org/ bigbluebutton main
}}}

to
{{{
#
# Repository for BigBlueButton
#
deb http://archive.bigbluebutton.org/dev bigbluebutton main
}}}

Do an `apt-get update/apt-get dist-upgrade` and you'll be running the latest builds, which are not guaranteed to be stable, but you can see what's happing in the current itteration.

== How to install desktop sharing ==
Desktop sharing is now a separate component.  Don't worry, you can install it with a single apt-get command. Please see [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/InstallingDesktopSharing how to install desktop sharing] and why doing so changes the licensing of !BigBlueButton.

== Modifying  !BigBlueButton == 

We've included all the development tools in this VM to compile and deploy the source for bigbluebutton-client, bigbluebutton-web, and bigbluebutton-apps. What are these components?  Take a moment and watch the [http://bigbluebutton.org/sites/all/videos/arch_overview/index.html  !BigBlueButton overview video].


=== Change IP address of  !BigBlueButton Server ===

The VM will automatically setup  !BigBlueButton components to use the IP address on first boot.  If you need to change the IP address of the server, we've provided a utility to let you change the configuration files for  !BigBlueButton to use the new IP address.

For example, to change the IP address for  !BigBlueButton configuration files to use 192.168.0.125, do the following

{{{

  $ sudo bbb-setip -h 192.168.0.125

}}}

If you want to change the default port as well, for example to have  !BigBlueButton listen on port 8000 (instead of 80), do the following

{{{

  $ sudo bbb-setip -h 192.168.0.125 -p 8000

}}}
