== Running BigBlueButton as a VM ==

Many users have told us they wanted to run their own version BigBlueButton.  Developers have asked us for ways to shorten the edit-compile-check cycle when making changes to the BigBlueButton source.

In response to these requests, we've created a Ubuntu-based virtual machine (VM) that makes it easy for anyone to download and run a BigBlueButton server.  The VM runs under VMWare Player, which is available on Unix, Windows, or Mac. This VM is a fully working version of the BigBlueButton Server. It has a full development environment preconfigured so you to check out code from BigBlueButton Google Code repository, make local changes, and, with a single command, re-compile the code and see it run in your VM.

Prerequisitis:
  * VMWare Player (or VMWare Workstation) for Windows or Unix, or VM Fusion for Mac
  * VMWare Fusion for Mac
  * Ability for the VM to acquire an IP address through DHCP on boot

=== Instructions ===

  # Download and uncompress the latest [http://bigbluebutton.org/downloads/bigbluebutton-vm.zip bigbluebutton-vm.zip]
  # Uncompress bigbluebutton-vm.zip and open the enclosed *ubuntu-vmw6* folder.

  # Double-click on the bigbluebutton-vm.vmx icon.  This will start VMWare Player (or VMWare Workstation).

The BigBlueButton VM takes about 10 minutes to initialize.  Sit back, relax, go watch some youtube videos.  During this time, the BigBlueButton VM goes through an initial startup script, which 

  * Installs a software timer for Asterisk (this allows you to use a VoIP phone to connect)
  * Updates all the installed packages
  * Configures BigBlueButton to use the VM's current IP address
  * Installing OpenSSH

When its finished you'll see a welcome message.

This message that tells you the IP address of the VM.  The VM has a default account called 'firstuser', with password 'default' (no quotes).  This message will also appear each time you login as first user.

== Resetting the password ==

You should login as first user and change the password.  After you login, you'll be asked to enter the old password again and provide a new password.  Take a moment and do this as it will make your VM secure.

Note: If you use putty to access the VM, the terminal window will close after you reset the password.  Don't worry, just open a new session and login with the new password.


== Running BigblueButton ==

Now the easy part.  Open a web browser to the URL provided in the login message for first user.  For example, if your IP for the BigBlueButton VM is 192.168.0.125, then open the following URL

    http://192.168.0.125/

You'll see a welcome screen that lets you join a default session.
  

== Updating the BigBlueButton VM == 

Updating is also easy.  All the BigBlueButton components are installed as Ubuntu packages that are automatically built
using the latest trunk.  To update the VM with the latest components, do the following.

Login as first user.  Enter the following commands:
{{{
  # apt-get update
  # apt-get upgrade
}}}


== Modifying BigBlueButton == 

We've included all the development tools in this VM to compile and deploy the source for BigBlueButton's client, web, and applications (which run in red5).


=== Change IP address of BigBlueButton Server ===

The VM will automatically setup BigBlueButton components to use the IP address on first boot.  If you need to change the IP address of the server, we've provided a utility to let you change the configuration files for BigBlueButton to use the new IP address.

For example, to change the IP address for BigBlueButton configuration files to use 192.168.0.125, do the following

{{{

  $ sudo bbb-setip -h 192.168.0.125

}}}

If you want to change the default port as well, for example to have BigBlueButton listen on port 8000 (instead of 80), do the following

{{{

  $ sudo bbb-setip -h 192.168.0.125 -p 8000

}}}

=== Setup Development Environment ===

To setup your development environment, do the following

#  Login as firstuser (you'll be prompted to change the password if you haven't done so already).

If you are on windows and want to use an editor (such as Eclipse) to modify the source on the VM, then we've included a tool to share the dev folder:

#  Type

{{{

  $ sudo bbb-setupdev -s

}}}

This will share your dev folder via samba.

=== Setup Development Environment ===

To checkout the code and setup your development environment, do the following

#  Type

{{{
   $ bbb-setupdev -d
}}}

This will checkout 

# bigbluebutton-dev
# bigbluebutton-client
# bigbluebutton-apps
