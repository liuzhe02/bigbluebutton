#summary Download and setup your own BigBlueButton 0.8 Virtual Machine

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Running BigBlueButton in a Virtual Machine =

This page describes how to download and run the !BigBlueButton 0.8 VM.  The VM is an easy way to have a fully working !BigBlueButton server in a few minutes.  The VM runs under VMWare Player, which is available on Unix, Windows, or Mac (on the Mac it's called VMWare Fusion).  

We've also pre-configured the VM so it can serve as a full [DevelopingBBB development environment].  We've added scripts (using `bbb-conf`) to make it easy for a developer to setup a development environment, make local changes, and, with a few commands, re-compile various components of !BigBlueButton for development and testing.  

Note: Running a !BigBlueButton VM within your desktop computer is good for testing !BigBlueButton with small groups of people (the actual number will depend on the speed of your VM host), but if your are going to setup !BigBlueButton production use, we recommend running !BigBlueButton on a dedicated server.  See [FAQ#What_are_the_minimum_hardware_requirements_for_the_BigBlueButton minimum requirements].

== Requirements == 
The requirements for running the !BigBlueButton VM are:
  # VMWare Player (or VMWare Workstation) for Windows or Unix, or VM Fusion for Mac
  # 2 G of free memory to run the VM
  # A DHCP Server for the VM to acquire an IP address on boot

The third requirement is important: the VM must be able to connect to the internet to update from packages.  If it does not acquire an IP address, it won't be able to finish the setup of !BigBlueButton.

== Installing !BigBlueButton VM  ==

  1.  Download and uncompress the the !BigBlueButton VM. 

Download bigbluebutton08-beta-4-VM.zip from !SourceForge: [http://sourceforge.net/projects/bigbluebutton/files/  Download ]

Note: Don't worry that the file name is bigbluebutton08-beta-4-VM.zip -- the VM will automatically update itself to the latest version of BigBlueButton 0.8 upon first boot.

  2.  Open the enclosed folder.


http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bbb-images/vm/vm_icons.png

  3.  Double-click on the bigbluebutton-vm.vmx icon.  

This will start VMWare Player/Workstation (or VMWare Fusion on the Mac) and boot the VM. Note: Make sure the networking is set to *Bridged*, not NAT.  

The !BigBlueButton VM takes about 10 minutes to first initialize.  Sit back, relax, go watch some YouTube videos.  During this time, the !BigBlueButton VM goes through its initial startup script that 

  * Sets up the networking (acquire an IP address from a DHCP server)
  * Downloads and installs the latest !BigBlueButton packages
  * Configures  !BigBlueButton to use the VM's current IP address
  * Installs OpenSSH

When it's done, you'll see a login prompt.  *NOTE:* The VM has been pre-configured to have the following user-id/password:

  user-id: *firstuser*

  password: *default*

*To secure your server, immediately login with the above user-id/password.*  This password is set to expire, so you'll be asked to enter the password *default* again, then to provide a new password (entering it twice to confirm).  Again, do this now as it will secure your server.  

After resetting the default password, you'll get a welcome message (this appears each time you login as firstuser).  You can access the !BigBlueButton server using the URL given in the welcome message.

== Running the !BigBlueButton VM ==

At this point, you've got a full !BigBlueButton server up and running.  Open a web browser to the URL provided using the IP address of the VM.  
  
== Developing !BigBlueButton == 

We've included all the development tools in this VM to compile and deploy the source for bigbluebutton-client, bigbluebutton-web, and bigbluebutton-apps. (see 08SettingDevEnvironment)

= Upgrading the !BigBlueButton VM =



== How to upgrade to the next release == 

This is where packages make life easy.

The !BigBlueButton components are installed as Ubuntu packages.  The VM already has apt configure to check the repository http://archive.bigbluebutton.org for updates.  This means, when we ship !BigBlueButton 0.8 final (for example), you'll be able to upgrade your server with two commands.

{{{
  # sudo apt-get update
  # sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
}}}

When you run these commands, you'll see !BigBlueButton download a packages for the new release.  You may be prompted to update an existing configuration file.

*Note*: Best to always check the [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/ReleaseNotes release notes] for specific instructions to upgrade to a new release.


= Troubleshooting =

== The console gives an error when booting ==

When the VM first boots, it acquires an IP address and runs a setup script to finish the installation of !BigBlueButton.   The script:
  # updating the packages 
  # installs !BigBlueButton

The update step ensures that any updates to packages issued after the release of the !BigBlueButton VM will be automatically downloaded before installation proceeded.

The most common error that prevents update and installation is occurs when the !BigBlueButton VM failed to acquire an IP address.  When this occurs, you'll see errors in the console when booting.

You can manually finish the installation process, but you first need to ensure the VM has (1) acquired an IP address and (2) the IP address is accessible by the host computer.

First, check in VMWare Player that has networking set to *bridged*.  Next, type

{{{
    ping google.com
}}}

You should get some ping results

{{{
   PING google.com (72.14.204.99) 56(84) bytes of data.
   64 bytes from iad04s01-in-f99.1e100.net (72.14.204.99): icmp_seq=1 ttl=54 time=4.54 ms
   64 bytes from iad04s01-in-f99.1e100.net (72.14.204.99): icmp_seq=2 ttl=54 time=4.42 ms
}}}

If not, it means that the VM is unable to acquire an IP address from a DHCP server on the network.  If there is a DHCP serer, you can try 

{{{
    sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
}}}

Try the ping command again.  If you are unable to acquire an IP address, check out this resource [https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/C/networking.html Ubuntu Networking].

Next, you can manually finish the setup to !BigBlueButton with the following commands:

{{{
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade
    sudo apt-get install bigbluebutton
}}}

There should be no errors when you type the above three commands.

== The IP address of my VM has changed and now !BigBlueButton does not work ==
Next, you'll need to ensure that !BigBlueButton is listening to the IP address of your VM.  One symptom is when you try to access !BigBlueButton through the web browser you get the `Welcome to nginx!` message.

To check your current environment for possible problems that might prevent !BigBlueButton from running, type the following command:

{{{

   sudo bbb-conf --check

}}}

If there are any problems (i.e. if bbb-conf detects that red5 isn't running), you'll see a warning message at the bottom.

The output from above showed that !BigBlueButton's configuration files were listening to IP address 192.168.0.163.  When you type the command, if the IP address shown for your output differs from the IP address of your VM, you can change the IP address that !BigBlueButton is using `bbb-conf`.  

For example, if the output from `ifconfig` shows your VM is listening to IP address 192.168.0.125, then issue the following command

{{{

  sudo bbb-conf --setip 192.168.0.125

}}}


If you need to restart !BigBlueButton, do the command

{{{

   bbb-conf --clean

}}}

and this will do a clean restart.  


== Check if you have a internet connection ==

{{{
ping www.google.com
}}}

If you get an error saying your eth0 is not connected, check if the VM is using eth1:

{{{
ifconfig -a
}}}

If it shows the following:

{{{
eth1      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:0c:29:dd:b4:51
          inet addr:192.168.0.154  Bcast:192.168.0.255  Mask:255.255.255.0

          RX bytes:40299608 (40.2 MB)  TX bytes:40299608 (40.2 MB)
}}}

Make it use eth0 instead
{{{
vi /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
}}}

This will show:
{{{
# This file was automatically generated by the /lib/udev/write_net_rules
# program, run by the persistent-net-generator.rules rules file.
#
# You can modify it, as long as you keep each rule on a single
# line, and change only the value of the NAME= key.

# PCI device 0x1022:0x2000 (pcnet32)
SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", DRIVERS=="?*", ATTR{address}=="00:0c:29:23:d1:b3", ATTR{type}=="1", KERNEL=="eth*", NAME="eth1"

# PCI device 0x1022:0x2000 (pcnet32)
SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", DRIVERS=="?*", ATTR{address}=="00:0c:29:dd:b4:51", ATTR{type}=="1", KERNEL=="eth*", NAME="eth0"

}}}

Swap the two entries by editing "NAME=eth1" to "NAME=eth0" and vice versa.

Reboot your machine. Check if you manage to connect to the internet. Make sure the VM's network adapter is using a Bridged connection instead of NAT. On the VMWare player this is enabled in the Devices menu at the top.
