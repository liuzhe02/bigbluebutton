#How to run BigBlueButton in a Virtual Machine

DRAFT - DRAFT 
= Introduction =

== Running BigBlueButton as a VM ==

Many users have said they wanted download and run BigBlueButton behind their firewall.  We've also heard from developers who want to setup a BigBlueButton development environment quickly.  

In response to these requests, we've created a Ubuntu-based virtual machine (VM) that runs under VMWare Player on Unix or Windows.  This virtual machine provides a full BigBlueButton server and development environment.

Prerequisitis:
  * VMWare Player (or VMWare Workstation)
  * Ability for the VM to acquire an IP address through DHCP on boot

=== Instructions ===

  # Download and uncompress the latest [http://bigbluebutton.org/sites/default/files/vm/bigbluebutton-vm.zip latest BigBlueButton VM ]

  # Open the ubuntu-vmw6 folder.

  # Double-click on the bigbluebutton-vm.vmx icon.  This will start VMWare Player (or VMWare Workstation).

The BigBlueButton VM takes about 10 minutes to initialize.  Sit back, relax, go watch some youtube videos.  During this time, the BigBlueButton VM goes through an initial startup script, which 

  * Installs a software timer for Asterisk (this allows you to use a VoIP phone to connect)
  * Updates all the installed packages
  * Configures BigBlueButton to use the VM's current IP address
  * Installing OpenSSH

When its finished you'll see a welcome message.

This message that tells you the IP address of the VM.  The VM has a default account called 'firstuser', with password 'default' (no quotes).  This message will also appear each time you login as first user.

== Resetting the password ==

You should login as first user and change the password.  After you login, you'll be asked to enter the old password again and provide a new password.  Take a moment and do this as it will make your VM secure.

Note: If you use putty to access the VM, the terminal window will close after you reset the password.  Don't worry, just open a new session and login with the new password.


== Running BigblueButton ==

Now the easy part.  Open a web browser to the URL provided in the login message for first user.  For example, if your IP for the BigBlueButton VM is 192.168.0.125, then open the following URL

    http://192.168.0.125/bigbluebutton/conference-session/joinIn/85115

This will join you into a default session.
  

== Updating the BigBlueButton VM == 

Updating is also easy.  All the BigBlueButton components are installed as Ubuntu packages that are automatically built
using the latest trunk.  To update the VM with the latest components, do the following.

Login as first user.  Enter the following commands:
{{{
  # apt-get update
  # apt-get upgrade
}}}


== Modifying BigBlueButton == 

We've included all the development tools in this VM to compile and deploy the source for BigBlueButton's client, web, and applications (which run in red5).

To setup your development environment, do the following

#  Login as firstuser (you'll be prompted to change the password if you haven't done so already).

If you are on windows and want to use an editor (such as Eclipse) to modify the source on the VM, then we've included a tool to share the dev folder:

#  Type

{{{

  $ sudo bbb-setupdev -s

}}}

This will share your dev folder via samba.

=== Setup Development Environment ===

To checkout the code and setup your development environment, do the following

#  Type

{{{
   $ bbb-setupdev -d
}}}

This will checkout 

# bigbluebutton-dev
# bigbluebutton-client
# bigbluebutton-apps

Where to go for help

Submit your questions and feedback to the bigbluebutton-dev mailing list.  This way, we can quickly fix any errors and improve the VM based on your feedback.
