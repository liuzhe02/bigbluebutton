#How to run BigBlueButton in a Virtual Machine

== Running BigBlueButton as a VM ==

We know that many users want to download and run BigBlueButton behind their firewall.  We've also heard from developers who want to start modifying BigBlueButton quickly.  

To make easy to run and develop your own BigBlueButton server, we've created a Ubuntu-based virtual machine (VM) that runs under VMWare Player on Unix or Windows.  This machine is a full BigBlueButton server and development environment.

Prerequisitis:
  * VMWare Player (or VMWare Workstation)
  * Ability for the VM to acquire an IP address through DHCP on boot

=== Instructions ===

  # Download and uncompress the latest [http://bigbluebutton.org/sites/default/files/vm/bigbluebutton-vm.zip latest BigBlueButton VM ]

  # Open the bigbluebutton-vm folder. 

http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bbb-images/vm/vm_icons.png

  # Double-click on the bigbluebutton-vm.vmx icon.  This will start VMWare Player (or VMWare Workstation).

The BigBlueButton VM takes about 10 minutes to initialize.

Sit back, relax, go watch some youtube videos.  During this time, the BigBlueButton VM goes through an initial startup script, which 

  * Installs a software timer for Asterisk (this allows you to use a VoIP phone to connect)
  * Updates all the installed packages
  * Configures BigBlueButton to use the VM's current IP address
  * Installing OpenSSH

When its finished you'll see a welcome message.


This message that tells you the IP address of the VM.  The VM has a default account called 'firstuser', with password 'default' (no quotes).  This message will also appear each time you login as first user.

== Resetting the password ==

You should login as first user and change the password.  After you login, you'll be asked to enter the old password again and provide a new password.  Take a moment and do this as it will make your VM secure.

Note: If you use putty to access the VM, the terminal window will close after you reset the password.  Don't worry, just open a new session and login with the new password.


== Running BigblueButton ==

Now the easy part.  Open a web browser to the URL provided in the login message for first user.  For example

    http://192.168.0.101/

You should see a welcome screen showing two options: login using account 'admin@test.com' and password 'admin'.
  

== Updating the BigBlueButton VM == 

Updating is also easy.  All the BigBlueButton components are installed as Ubuntu packages that are automatically built
using the latest trunk.  To update the VM with the latest components, do the following.

Login as first user.  Enter the following commands:
{{{
  # apt-get update
  # apt-get upgrade
}}}


== How to use the BigBlueButton VM to develop == 

Login as firstuser and change to the dev directory.  You'll see the setup
