#summary How to setup your own BigBlueButton Virtual Machine

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Running a full !BigBlueButton 0.63 Server in a few minutes (Draft)=

Many universities and colleges have told us they wanted to run their own version  !BigBlueButton behind their firewall.  In addition, our developers have asked us for ways to shorten the edit-compile-check cycle when extending  !BigBlueButton.

In response to these requests, we've created a Ubuntu-based virtual machine (VM) that makes it easy for anyone to download and run a  !BigBlueButton server.  The VM runs under VMWare Player, which is available on Unix, Windows, or Mac.  This VM is also a full [Developing_BigBlueButton development environment] -- it's preconfigured to check out code from !BigBlueButton Google Code repository, make local changes, and, with a single command, re-compile the code and see it run in your VM.  

Let's get a !BigBlueButton VM going.  

Prerequisites:
  * VMWare Player (or VMWare Workstation) for Windows or Unix, or VM Fusion for Mac
  * A DHCP Server for the VM to acquire an IP address on boot
  * The VM must be able to connect to the internet to update packages

== Installing !BigBlueButton VM  ==

  1.  Download and uncompress the [http://bigbluebutton.org/downloads/bigbluebutton-vm-2010-01-25.zip BigBlueButton 0.63 VM] 

  2.  Open the enclosed *ubuntu-vmw6* folder.

http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bbb-images/vm/vm_icons.png

  3.  Double-click on the bigbluebutton-vm.vmx icon.  

This will start VMWare Player (or VMWare Workstation) and boot the VM. Note: In VMWare, make sure the networking is set to *Bridged*, not NAT.  

The !BigBlueButton VM takes about 10 minutes to first initialize.  Sit back, relax, go watch some youtube videos.  During this time, the !BigBlueButton VM goes through its initial startup script that 

  * Sets up the networking (acquire an IP address from a DHCP server)
  * Installs the  !BigBlueButton packages
  * Configures  !BigBlueButton to use the VM's current IP address
  * Installs OpenSSH

When it's done, you'll see a welcome message that asks you to login and change the password.

The VM is setup to have a default account called *firstuser* with password *default*.  To secure your server, take a moment to login and change this password.

To change the password, login as firstuser and provide the default password.  You'll immediately be asked to enter the password again, then to provide a new password.  Again, do this now as it will secure your server.  

After resetting the default password, you'll get the following welcome message (this appears each time you login as firstuser).

== Running the !BigBlueButton VM ==

At this point, you've got a full !BigBlueButton server up and running.  Open a web browser to the URL provided using the IP address of the VM.

Enter whatever name you like and then click Join.  You'll join the default meeting.

== Updating the  !BigBlueButton VM == 

The !BigBlueButton components are installed as Ubuntu packages.  The VM already has apt configure to check the repository http://archive.bigbluebutton.org for updates.  This means, when we ship BigBlueButton 0.64 (for example), you'll be able to upgrade your server with two commands.

{{{
  # sudo apt-get update
  # sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
}}}

When you run these commands, you'll see BigBlueButton download a packages for the new release.  You may be prompted to update an existing configuration file.

*Note*: Best to always check the [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/ReleaseNotes release notes] for specific instructions to upgrade to a new release.

When updating, you'll see the upgrade messages.

== Updating the !BigBlueButton VM: Living on the Edge == 

We upgrade the repository http://archive.bigbluebutton.org with every release.  In addition, during each iteration of BigBlueButton, we have our [http://bigbluebutton.org/hudson continuous integration server Hudson] automatically updating packages off of the SVN tree in Google Code.

These packages are used to update our [http://devbuild.bigbluebutton.org devbuild server], so you can always try out the latest version.  Keep in mind that trunk isn't always going to be stable, so devbuild will be as stable as trunk.

However, if you want to live on the edge and use the latest packages built by our from the trunk of the !BigBlueButton Google Code repository, then edit `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/bigbluebutton.list` and change

{{{
#
# Repository for BigBlueButton
#
deb http://archive.bigbluebutton.org/ bigbluebutton main
}}}

to
{{{
#
# Repository for BigBlueButton
#
deb http://archive.bigbluebutton.org/dev bigbluebutton main
}}}

Do an `apt-get update/apt-get dist-upgrade` and you'll be running the latest builds, which are not guaranteed to be stable, but you can see what's happing in the current itteration.

== How to install desktop sharing ==
Desktop sharing is now a separate component.  Don't worry, you can install it with a single apt-get command. Please see [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/InstallingDesktopSharing how to install desktop sharing] and why doing so changes the licensing of !BigBlueButton.

== Modifying  !BigBlueButton == 

We've included all the development tools in this VM to compile and deploy the source for bigbluebutton-client, bigbluebutton-web, and bigbluebutton-apps. See [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/Developing_BigBlueButton developing BigBlueButton] for more information.


== Troubleshooting ==

If BigBlueButton server is not working, the script bbb-conf is your friend.  As of BigBlueButton 0.63, we've added logic to bbb-conf to check your current environment for possible problems that might prevent BigBlueButton from running.  


=== Change IP address of  !BigBlueButton Server ===

The VM will automatically setup  !BigBlueButton components to use the IP address on first boot.  If you need to change the IP address of the server, we've provided a utility to let you change the configuration files for  !BigBlueButton to use the new IP address.

For example, to change the IP address for  !BigBlueButton configuration files to use 192.168.0.125, do the following

{{{

  $ sudo bbb-conf --setip 192.168.0.125

}}}
