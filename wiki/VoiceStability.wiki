The goal of this section is to summarize how we approach voice stability.

== Goals ==
Initial goals for this activity as stated by Tiago:

  * Creating workaround for network hiccups
  * Improve audio quality
  * Improve video quality

== Possible solutions ==

Can work around network hiccups through client-side monitoring.

Can improve audio quality by switching to another codec, avoiding TCP overhead, or echo messages.

Can improve video quality by transcoding to H264 or FFMPEG.

Both of the latter can be addressed by a local agent that is installed on each client.

Alternatively, we can directly talk to Asterisk from the client through SIP, circumventing the current transcoding layer inside BigBlueButton. Nadia's experiments with the SIP user agent show that this leads to a noticeable improvement in voice quality. 

What is the cost of using this approach?
