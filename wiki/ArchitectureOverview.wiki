The master branch of the [http://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton GIT repository] contains the following components of !BigBlueButton:

  * bigbluebutton-apps - The server side red5 web-apps of !BigBlueButton
  * bigbluebutton-client - The Flex/Flash client of !BigBlueButton
  * bigbluebutton-web - The Grails application for scheduling conferences and logging in/out
  * deskshare-app - The Desktop Sharing server side red5 web-app
  * deskshare-applet - The Applet program used to capture the screen on the client

Notes:
   * !BigBlueButton uses nginx as a proxy server to route incoming requests to the !BigBlueButton client, to tomcat6 (running on port 8080) for api calls, and for supporting HTTP tunnelling when the client connects using RTMPT (port 80) instead of RTMP (port 1935).

== !BigBlueButton Red5 Apps ==

We think Red5 rocks, and we use it as the core server for handling all the real-time interaction with the client.

== !BigBlueButton Client ==

We've written the real-time client in Flash.  Since Flash 10, Flash is now available on Mac, Unix, and PCs, and it provides the interface for collaboration with other users.
