The trunk of the SVN repository contains the following important parts:

  * bigbluebutton-apps - The server side red5 web-apps of BigBlueButton

== BigBlueButton Red5 Apps ==

We think Red5 rocks, and we use it as the core server for handling all the real-time interaction with the client.

== BigBlueButton Client ==

We've written the real-time client in Flash.  Since Flash 10, Flash is now available on Mac, Unix, and PCs, and it provides the interface for collaboration with other users.
