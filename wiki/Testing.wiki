#summary Developer information for testing BigBlueButton

= Introduction =

The itended audience for this document is developers who want to load test, unit test, and stress test !BigBlueButton.

This document (currently in its early stages) gathers together the various approaches to testing !BigBlueButton so that other developers can participate in the testing.

The goal is to make !BigBlueButton 

== Quick checks ==

!BigBlueButton has a lot of ConfigurationFiles; to see if your !BigBlueButton server is properly configured, use the command

{{{
   sudo bbb-conf --check
}}}

And look for any messages printed after "* Possible Problems *".  

The !BigBlueButton process generate a lot of log files.  To quickly scan all the log files for errors or exceptions, use the command

{{{
   sudo bbb-conf --debug
}}}

After !BigBlueButton has been running for a while, the log files get large.  When figuring out exactly what caused the error, a common technique is to do the following:

{{{
   sudo bbb-conf --clean
   sudo bbb-conf --watch
}}}

This will clean out all the log files (so there are no errors in the loogs), and display in the terminal the network activity and output of `bbb-conf --debug` every two seconds.
