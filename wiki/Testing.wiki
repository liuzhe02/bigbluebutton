#summary Developer information for testing BigBlueButton

= Introduction =

This document is intended for developers who want to help load test, unit test, and stress test !BigBlueButton.

This document (currently in its early stages) gathers together the various approaches to testing !BigBlueButton.

== Quick checks ==

!BigBlueButton has a lot of ConfigurationFiles.  A quick check to see if your !BigBlueButton server is properly configured, use the command

{{{
   sudo bbb-conf --check
}}}

This script runs through numerous checks for missing process, incorrect parameter in configuration files, missing packages, Unix ports that don't have any listeners, and known error messages in log files that indicate a configuration problem.  An warnings or potential errors are printed after the message "* Possible Problems *".  

The !BigBlueButton process generate a lot of log files.  To quickly scan all the log files for errors or exceptions, use the command

{{{
   sudo bbb-conf --debug
}}}

After !BigBlueButton has been running for a while, the log files get large.  When figuring out exactly what caused the error, a common technique is to do the following:

{{{
   sudo bbb-conf --clean
   sudo bbb-conf --watch
}}}

This will clean out all the log files (so there are no errors in the loogs), and display in the terminal the network activity and output of `bbb-conf --debug` every two seconds.
