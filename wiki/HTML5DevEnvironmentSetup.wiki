#summary Set up a development environment for the BigBlueButton HTML5 client

= HTML5 Development Environment Setup =

== Initial setup ==

Before you begin, you will need to have a BigBlueButton server installed from packages. For best results, start with the BigBlueButton 0.81-development packages, as the HTML5 client is based on this version. Follow the instructions on [081InstallationUbuntu] for details.

You then have to convert your installation to a development environment, since the HTML5 client is on a separate branch and requires some components to be rebuilt.

You can follow the instructions at [DevelopingBBB] with the following changes:

  * Under "Checking out the source", use the git command `git checkout -b html5-bridge origin/html5-bridge` to switch to the HTML5 client branch.
  * At a minimum, you must build and deploy or run the Client, BBB-Web, and Red5 Applications components.

== HTML5 Bridge component ==

=== Installation ===

The HTML5 bridge component is currently written using node.js. Since Ubuntu 10.04 doesn't ship an up-to-date version of node.js, it's easiest to use a PPA:

{{{
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nodejs npm
}}}

Now you can use `npm` to install the node.js dependencies:

{{{
cd ~/dev/bigbluebutton/labs/bbb-html5-client
npm install
}}}

=== Running ===

The HTML5 client uses the redis database to store information about the meetings. Right now, there isn't an "automatic" way to delete the keys, so it's recommended that each time that you run the html5 client, you should clean the redis database.

Clean the database: 

{{{
redis-cli flushdb
}}}

Perform a clean restart of BigBlueButton

{{{
sudo bbb-conf --clean
}}}

Run the HTML5 client bridge:

{{{
cd ~/dev/bigbluebutton/labs/bbb-html5-client
node app.js
}}}
