#summary How to localize BigBlueButton

= Contributing the new language translation to !BigBlueButton =

We are now using [https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bigbluebutton transifex] to make contributing/updating a translation easy for !BigBlueButton community.  To help translate !BigBlueButton into your language, do the following:

*1. Create an account on [https://www.transifex.com/ transifex.com]*

*2. Visit the [https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bigbluebutton/ BigBlueButton project] on Transifex*

You'll see a list of languages ready for translation.  

*3. Click the name of the language you wish to translate*

*4. Click 'Join team' to join the localization team for your language*

http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bbb-images/localization/join.PNG

At this point, Transifex will send an e-mail to the coordinator for !BigBlueButton localization requesting approval. You should receive approval very quickly.

*5. Once approved, click the 'bbbResource.properties' link*

http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bbb-images/localization/image1.PNG

You'll see a dialog box where you can begin translation.

*6. Click the 'Translate Now' button*

http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bbb-images/localization/approved.PNG

At this point, you'll see the Transifex localization window for your language.

You can now click on a string in the left-hand panel and enter/review the translation for it.  

Translation tips:
  * You don't need to translate the numbers
  * Some strings have variables in them such as {0} and {1} -- these will be substituted by !BigBlueButton with parameters.
  * You'll see duplicate strings as many controls have two localations: one for sighted users, and one for blind users using a screen reader.  Please translate both.

For help in using Transifex's web editor, see [http://support.transifex.com/customer/portal/articles/972120-introduction-to-the-web-editor intro to web editor].

As the translations are updated by the community, we will sync them with   [https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/tree/master/bigbluebutton-client/locale locale] so they get into master.

If the language you are looking for is not available on the localization server, post on the [http://groups.google.com/group/bigbluebutton-dev/topics?gvc=2 BigBlueButton Mailing List].

Finally, if you have any questions, please post to [http://groups.google.com/group/bigbluebutton-dev/topics?gvc=2 bigbluebutton-dev].


== Technical Background  ==

!BigBlueButton localization follows the i18n standard. !BigBlueButton Client will detect the locale of the language of the browser running it and attempt to load that language file. 

Language files are compiled into swf files and loaded dynamically based on the browser locale. This reduces the size of the client. Language codes follow the convention of a two letter lowercase language name, followed by an underscore, followed by two upper-case latters signifying the country code. So for example the default english for the United States would be: *en_US*

== Compiling your own language files into your client ==
If you created a custom language file but do not wish to contribute back to the project, here are the instructions on how to compile the language files yourself.


  #  Put the template file into a new folder. The folder name should follow the language code convention stated above for the language/country the language file is written for. Put the folder under bigbluebutton-client/locale.
  # The file will be loaded whenever the user's broswer is set to that language/country code. Optionally, you could overwrite the english language files if you think that most of your users are running english language broswers, but would still like them to load a specific language.


Rebuild the client. Go to the client source directory - on the VM usually /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client/, and run the command

{{{
   ant locales
}}}

To have the client load your locale, you need to add it to the locales.xml located in resources/prod folder.

Refer to the [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/FAQ#My_client_fails_at_startup_with_RSL_error;_Error_2035:URL_Not_Fo FAQ] if you have problems with Ant and Flex

== Testing your localization  ==
There is a Firefox plug-in, "Quick Locale Switcher", that can be used for testing the localizations. The plug-in is available [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1333 here]. When this plug-in is installed, you will have a menu at the bottom right hand corner that allows you to change the locale in the browser.

== Overwriting the English Translation with your Language ==
If you think most of your users are running browsers set for English but would still like !BigBlueButton to load with a different language, you can delete the en_US.swf file from the directory where you deployed the bbb-client. Then rename your localization to en_US.swf. So for example if you wanted the Spanish language to be the default, just rename the file es_ES.swf to en_US.swf.

Or you can edit [https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/blob/master/bigbluebutton-client/resources/prod/lib/bbb_localization.js] to force the default to locale to what you want.
