#summary Setting up the development environment for BigBlueButton 0.81

= Note =

We have not yet released !BigBlueButton 0.81-beta, so these instructions will change (and many not work) until 0.81-beta is release.

We recommend that unless you've already been developing with !BigBlueButton to wait until 0.81-beta is out.

= Overview =
!BigBlueButton 0.81-dev uses the latest version of red5.  You will not be able to develop 0.81-dev using the version of red5 that ships with 0.80.

= Getting Started =

To get started, first install !BigBlueButton 0.81-dev using the instructions [081InstallationUbuntu here].

Next, setup your development environment following the instructions [DevelopingBBB here].
