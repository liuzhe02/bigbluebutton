#How to install BigBlueButton on Ubuntu 

= Introduction =

Using Ubuntu/Debian packages, it's very easy to get a server up and running on Ubuntu.  The following instructions will install and configure all the components except Asterisk, which provides the voice conference.

== Prerequisites ==

You'll need root access to the server.  The following instructions assume you are using sudo to execute commands as root.

First, you need to add the BigBlueButton key and repository URL to apt-get, then update the list of available packages.

{{{
   wget http://archive.bigbluebutton.org/bigbluebutton.asc 
   sudo apt-key add bigbluebutton.asc 
   sudo echo "deb http://archive.bigbluebutton.org/ bigbluebutton main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bigbluebutton.list 
   sudo apt-get update 
}}}

Next, enter the following command

{{{
   sudo apt-get install bigbluebutton 
}}}

You'll be presented with a list of packages to install.

Enter 'Y' and apt-get will download and install everything you need.  If you don't have mysql installed, you'll be asked to provide the root password.

One of the BigBlueButton components is bbb-web, which provides the web-based interface for scheduling conferences.  It needs to create a database, so it needs to know the mysql password (provide the same password if you were just prompted for it by mysql).

== Trying out your server ==

Near the end, you'll see bbb-client installed, and you'll see the URL for BigBlueButton.

Enter this URL in your web browser and you should have BigBlueButton home page.

If you need to change the hostname (or IP address), you can use `bbb-setip`, a utility shell script included in the BigBlueButton install, to make the global changes necessary to BigBlueButton's configuration files.

For example, to switch the BigBlueButton server to use IP address 192.168.0.100, enter the follwoing

{{{
sudo bbb-setip -h 192.168.0.100
}}}

Then open 

{{{
http://192.168.0.100/
}}}

and viola, instant BigBlueButton gratification.

Note: If you apply a host name using bbb-setip that is long, such as when installing this on an Amazon EC2 instance and use the public DNS host name (which is something linke ec2-75-101-208-128.compute-1.amazonaws.com), you'll need to increase the allowable host name size for nginx.  

To do this, edit `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` and insert `server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;` as shown below.

{{{
http {
    include       /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    default_type  application/octet-stream;

    access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log;

    sendfile        on;
    #tcp_nopush     on;

    #keepalive_timeout  0;
    keepalive_timeout  65;
    tcp_nodelay        on;

    gzip  on;

    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
    include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;

    server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;  
}
}}}

Run bbb-setip again, which will restart nginx, and you should be ready to go.
