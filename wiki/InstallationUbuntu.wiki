#summary How to install  BigBlueButton on Ubuntu in under 10 minutes

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Installing !BigBlueButton using Ubuntu Packages =

Using Ubuntu packages, it's very easy to get a  !BigBlueButton server up and running on any Ubuntu 9.04 x32 (desktop or server) in about ten minutes (depending on your download speed).

== Prerequisites ==

You'll need root access to your Ubuntu 9.04 machine.  

Also,  !BigBlueButton uses nginx, which listens on port 80 for http access and tunneling, so if you have apache running, you'll need to tell apache to listen to a different port by editing /etc/apache2/ports.conf and changing the entry for 80 to another number, such as 8081.  Avoid setting apache2 to port 8080 as  !BigBlueButton uses tomcat6 which listens on that port.

== There are five commands to setup your own !BigBlueButton Server == 

There are five commands you need (cut and paste below).  The first four commands download the !BigBlueButton repository key, add the key and repository URL to apt-get's list of sources, then instruct apt-get to update the list of available packages.

{{{
   wget http://archive.bigbluebutton.org/bigbluebutton.asc 
   sudo apt-key add bigbluebutton.asc 
   echo "deb http://archive.bigbluebutton.org/ bigbluebutton main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bigbluebutton.list
   sudo apt-get update 
   sudo apt-get install bigbluebutton 

}}}

The last command is where all the magic.  This one command will install *all* of !BigBlueButton (except for desktop sharing, see below) along with all its dependencies.  Here's a screen shot of the packages it will install.

Enter 'Y'.  Then sit back.

After a few moments, if you don't have mysql installed, the mysql setup script will ask to provide a password for the mysql user 'root'.

Next, the setup script for the scheduling component of !BigBlueButton needs to access the mysql database to create the database for BigBlueButton.  You need to provide it the same password your did a moment ago.

== Trying out your server ( 8:42 minutes later) ==

After a few moments, everything will be installed --- including the voice conference server using Asterisk.  You've got a full !BigBlueButton server up and running that you can use.  Open a web browser to the URL provided using the IP address of the VM.

Enter whatever name you like and then click Join.  You'll join the default meeting.

= Troubleshooting =

== Wait!  It didn't work! ==
If you can't login to the server, enter the following command.

{{{
   bbb-conf -c
}}}

The script bbb-conf is the BigBlueButton configuration script.  The -c will check your setup to ensure everything is working properly.  For example, here's the output on our demo server

{{{
Current Configuration:

/var/www/bigbluebutton/client/conf/config.xml (bbb-client)
                 IP for tunnel check: demo.bigbluebutton.org
                  IP for rtmp (red5): demo.bigbluebutton.org
          host for bbb-web interface: demo.bigbluebutton.org

/etc/nginx/sites-available/bigbluebutton (configuration file nginx)
                         server_name: demo.bigbluebutton.org
                                port: 80
                client document root: /var/www/bigbluebutton

/var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/bigbluebutton/WEB-INF/classes/bigbluebutton.properties (bbb-web)
                                host: demo.bigbluebutton.org

/var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/bigbluebutton/demo/bbb_api_conf.jsp (API demos)
                                host: demo.bigbluebutton.org

/etc/asterisk/bbb_extensions.conf (asterisk)
                   conference module: konference
}}}

One common problem is that not all the processes are running.  You can do a clean restart of BigBluebutton with the command.

{{{
   bbb-conf --clean
}}}


If you are accessing the server via an IP address, then another common problem is the IP address in BigBlueButton's configuration files is different than the IP address of the host server.  To change all of BigBlueButton's configuration files to use a different IP address, enter

If you need to change your IP address for BigBlueButton, the following command will update all the configuration files and restart the needed processes.

{{{
   bbb-conf --setip <ip_address>
}}}


== Keeping your server up-to-date with a new release ==

Want to keep your !BigBlueButton server up-to-date with the latest !BigBlueButton release?  No problem, just enter

{{{
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
}}}

and apt-get will download and install the released !BigBlueButton.  Don't you just love the power of Ubuntu/Debian packages.

== How to install desktop sharing ==
Desktop sharing is now a separate component.  Don't worry, you can install it with a single apt-get command. Please see [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/InstallingDesktopSharing how to install desktop sharing] and why doing so changes the licensing of !BigBlueButton.
