#How to install BigBlueButton on Ubuntu 

= Introduction =

Using Ubuntu/Debian packages, it's very easy to get a server up and running on Ubuntu.  The following instructions will install and configure all the components except Asterisk, which provides the voice conference.

== Prerequisites ==

You'll need root access to the server.  The following instructions assume you are using sudo to execute commands as root.

First, you need to add the BigBlueButton key and repository URL to apt-get, then update the list of available packages.

{{{
   wget http://archive.bigbluebutton.org/bigbluebutton.asc 
   sudo apt-key add bigbluebutton.asc 
   sudo echo "deb http://archive.bigbluebutton.org/ bigbluebutton main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bigbluebutton.list 
   sudo apt-get update 
}}

Next, enter the following command
{{
   sudo apt-get install bigbluebutton 
}}

You'll be presented with a list of packages to install.  Enter 'Y' and apt-get will download and install everything you need.
