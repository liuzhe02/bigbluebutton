#summary How to install  BigBlueButton on Ubuntu in under 10 minutes

= Installing !BigBlueButton using Ubuntu Packages =

Using Ubuntu packages, it's very easy to get a  !BigBlueButton server up and running on any Ubuntu 9.04 x32 (desktop or server) in about ten minutes (depending on your download speed).

== Prerequisites ==

You'll need root access to your Ubuntu 9.04 machine.  

Also,  !BigBlueButton uses nginx, which listens on port 80 for http access and tunneling, so if you have apache running, you'll need to tell apache to listen to a different port by editing /etc/apache2/ports.conf and changing the entry for 80 to another number, such as 8081.  Avoid setting apache2 to port 8080 as  !BigBlueButton uses tomcat6 which listens on that port.

== Let's go == 

First, you need to add the !BigBlueButton key and repository URL to apt-get, then instruct apt-get to update the list of available packages.

{{{
   wget http://archive.bigbluebutton.org/bigbluebutton.asc 
   sudo apt-key add bigbluebutton.asc 
   echo "deb http://archive.bigbluebutton.org/ bigbluebutton main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bigbluebutton.list
   sudo apt-get update 
}}}

Next, enter the following command

{{{
   sudo apt-get install bigbluebutton 
}}}

This is where all the magic happens.  This one command will install all of BigBlueButton along with all its dependencies.

Enter 'Y'.  After a few moments, if you don't have mysql installed, the mysql setup script will ask to provide a password for the mysql user 'root'.

Next, bbb-web, the scheduling component for a  !BigBlueButton conference, needs to access the mysql database, so just give it the same password your did a moment ago.

== Trying out your server ( 8:42 minutes later) ==

Once apt-get installs everything, your done.  Type

{{{
   bbb-conf -c
}}}

to check your setup.  If you need to change your IP address type

{{{
   bbb-conf --setip <ip_address>
}}}

There you have it. At this point, you've got a full !BigBlueButton server up and running.  Open a web browser to the URL provided using the IP address of the VM.

Enter whatever name you like and then click Join.  You'll join the default meeting.

Want to keep your BigBlueButton server up-to-date with the latest !BigBlueButton release?  No problem, just enter

{{{
  # apt-get update
  # apt-get dist-upgrade
}}}

and apt-get will download and install any updates to  !BigBlueButton.  Don't you just love the power of Ubuntu/Debian packages.

Note: If you install BigBlueButton on EC2, you'll need to open two ports: 1935 (for RTMP) and 9123 (for desktop sharing) on your EC2 instance. 

== How to install desktop sharing ==
Desktop sharing is now a separate component.  Don't worry, you can install it with a single apt-get command. Please see [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/InstallingDesktopSharing how to install desktop sharing] and why doing so changes the licensing of !BigBlueButton.
