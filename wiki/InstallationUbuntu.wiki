#summary How to install BigBlueButton on Ubuntu in under 5 minutes

= Introduction =

Using Ubuntu/Debian packages, it's very easy to get a BigBlueButton server up and running on Ubuntu in about five minutes.  The following instructions will install and configure all the components except Asterisk (see InstallingBigBlueButton for how to install Asterisk, which provides the voice conferencing).

== Prerequisites ==

You'll need root access to your Ubuntu machine (it can be server or workstation).  

Also, BigBlueButton uses nginx, which listens on port 80 for http access and tunneling, so if you have apache running, you'll need to tell apache to listen to a different port by editing /etc/apache2/ports.conf and changing the entry for 80 to another number, such as 8081.  Avoid setting apache2 to port 8080 as BigBlueButton uses tomcat6 which listens on that port.

== Let's go == 

First, you need to add the BigBlueButton key and repository URL to apt-get, then instruct apt-get to update the list of available packages.

{{{
   wget http://archive.bigbluebutton.org/bigbluebutton.asc 
   sudo apt-key add bigbluebutton.asc 
   sudo echo "deb http://archive.bigbluebutton.org/ bigbluebutton main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bigbluebutton.list 
   sudo apt-get update 
}}}

Next, enter the following command

{{{
   sudo apt-get install bigbluebutton 
}}}

This is where all the work is done.  Through figuring out dependencies, apt-get will present you a list of all the packages that need to be installed on your machine.

Enter 'Y'.  After a few moments, if you don't have mysql installed, the mysql setup script will ask to provide a password for the mysql user 'root'.

Next, bbb-web, the scheduling component for a BigBlueButton conference, needs to access the mysql database, so just give it the same password your did a moment ago.

== Trying out your server ( 4:42 minutes later) ==

Once apt-get installs everything, your done.  Near the end of the installation, you'll see the install script for bbb-web output the URL to load BigBlueButton. 

http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bbb-images/install_ubuntu/bbb-url.png

Enter this URL in your web browser and you should have BigBlueButton home page.  (Note: I used Amazon EC2 for the screen shots, which has an internal IP address of 10... and an external DNS host name, so you'll need to tell BigBlueButton to use the external DNS name, as described in the next section).

There you have it.  A BigBlueButton server (sans voice conferencing) up in running in about 5 minutes.

Want to keep your machine up-to-date with the latest BigBlueButton release?  No problem, just enter

{{{
  # apt-get update
  # apt-get upgrade
}}}

and apt-get will download and install any updates to BigBlueButton.  Don't you just love the power of Ubuntu/Debian packages.

One more note for EC2: you'll need to open two ports: 1935 (for RTMP) and 9123 (for desktop sharing) on your EC2 instance. 

=== Changing the host (or IP) address for BigBlueButton ===
If you need to change the hostname (or IP address), you can use `bbb-setip`, a utility shell script included in the BigBlueButton install, to make the global changes necessary to BigBlueButton's configuration files.

For example, to switch the BigBlueButton server to use IP address 192.168.0.100, enter the follwoing

{{{
sudo bbb-setip -h 192.168.0.100
}}}

=== Handling long host names in nginx ===
If you apply a long host name using bbb-setip, such as when installing this on an Amazon EC2 instance and use the public DNS host name (which is something linke ec2-75-101-208-128.compute-1.amazonaws.com), you'll get an error from nginx that the host name is too long.

Now worries, you just need to increase the allowable host name size for nginx.   To do this, edit `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` and insert `server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;` as shown below.

{{{
http {
    include       /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    default_type  application/octet-stream;

    access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log;

    sendfile        on;
    #tcp_nopush     on;

    #keepalive_timeout  0;
    keepalive_timeout  65;
    tcp_nodelay        on;

    gzip  on;

    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
    include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;

    server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;  
}
}}}

Run bbb-setip again, such as

{{{
sudo bbb-setip -h ec2-75-101-208-128.compute-1.amazonaws.com
}}}
which will restart nginx, and you should be ready to go.
