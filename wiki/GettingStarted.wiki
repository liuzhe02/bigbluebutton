#summary A quick guide to getting started with Developing in BigBlueButton.

= Overview =
We've put a lot of thought into the architecture of BigBlueButton.  Our goal was to make it easy for other developers to use BigBlueButton as a platform to build other collaborative applications.


== Trunk Overview ==

The trunk of the SVN repository contains the following important parts:

  * bigbluebutton-apps - The server side red5 web-apps of BigBlueButton
  * bigbluebutton-client - The Flex/Flash client of BigBlueButton
  * bigbluebutton-web - The Grails application for scheduling conferences and logging in/out
  * deskshare-app - The Desktop Sharing server side red5 web-app
  * deskshare-applet - The Applet program used to capture the screen on the client
