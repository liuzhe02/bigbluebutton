#summary A quick guide to getting started with Developing in BigBlueButton.

= Overview =
We've put a lot of thought into the architecture of BigBlueButton.  Our goal was to make it easy for other developers to use BigBlueButton as a platform to build other collaborative applications.

== Architecture Overview ==

The following diagram shows the major pieces of the BigBlueButton architecture.

== BigBlueButton Red5 Apps ==

We think Red5 rocks, and we use it as the core server for handling all the real-time interaction with the client.

== BigBlueButton Client ==

We've written the real-time client in Flash.  Since Flash 10, Flash is now available on Mac, Unix, and PCs, and it provides the interface for collaboration with other users.
