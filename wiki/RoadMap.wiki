#summary Development Road Map for BigBlueButton


= Current Release =

== Release 0.71 ==
We are currently in the development phase for !BigBlueButton 0.71.  You can read the [http://groups.google.com/group/bigbluebutton-dev/browse_thread/thread/6ffa48133ea7d2e6# minutes of the committers meeting] on 0.71.

In short, this release will focus investigating improvements to the VoIP and will look at using, in addition to asterisk, freeswitch and the speex codec in !BigBlueButton. 

While we don't give out release dates (we release on quality, not dates), you can tell when we enter our testing phase (and getting close to a release) by subscribing to the [http://groups.google.com/group/bigbluebutton-dev/topics?gvc=2 bigbluebutton-dev] mailing list.

== Release 0.8 ==
After 0.71 ships, the first iteration of record and playback (our #1 requested feature from educational institutions) is planned for 0.8.
