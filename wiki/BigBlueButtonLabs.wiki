#summary BigBlueButton Labs

= Introduction =

The purpose of !BigBlueButton Labs is to rapidly experiment and prototype new ideas to improve !BigBlueButton.

Unless a labs project states otherwise, these projects are exploratory in nature with no implied timeline to merge them into !BigBlueButton core.  In this way, developers working on labs project are free to experiment, collaborate, and, most importantly, get feedback from the community.

If you want to give feedback on a particular labs project, please post to [http://groups.google.com/group/bigbluebutton-dev/topics?gvc=2 bigbluebutton-dev].

== Installation of !BigBlueButton on other systems  ==

There are many components to !BigBlueButton and installing each component manually would take quite some time.  The Debian packaging for [InstallationUbuntu installing BigBlueButton] handles most of the steps.

The following labs projects were efforts to install older versions !BigBlueButton on other systems.  These instructions are no longer valid and need to be updated.  

    * [InstallationBigBlueButtonDebian Debian Squeeze] (v0.71a)
    * [InstallingBigBlueButtonFreeBSD FreeBSD/PC-BSD] (v0.70)
    * [InstallingBigBlueButtonCentOS Installing on CentOS ] (0.64)


These labs projects were exploring ways to expand the architecture (but are now inactive)
