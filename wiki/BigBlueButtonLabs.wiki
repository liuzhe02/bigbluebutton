#summary BigBlueButton Labs

= Introduction =

The purpose of !BigBlueButton Labs is to experiment and prototype new ideas to improve !BigBlueButton.

Unless a labs project states otherwise, these projects are exploratory in nature with no implied timeline to merge them into !BigBlueButton core.  In this way, developers working on labs project are free to experiment, collaborate, and get feedback from the community.
