The whiteboard now has a line tool and text tool (see [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/issues/detail?id=591 591]).  

== Layout Manger ==

For example, on startup !BigBlueButton will use the default layout.

You can the switch to a different layout and your windows will automatically resize.

The layout manager is developer friendly.  You can create a new layout on the screen, save the layout to new_layouts.xml, and then use the new layout to update the contents
