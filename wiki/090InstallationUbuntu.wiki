#summary How to install BigBlueButton 0.9.0-beta

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

Welcome to the installation guide for !BigBlueButton 0.9.0-beta.  !BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system for on-line learning.

For an overview what new in this release, see [090Overview overview].

If already have a !BigBlueButton 0.81 server, these instructions will *not* upgrade your server.  To install !BigBlueButton 0.9.0-beta, you need to install on a clean installation of Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit.  The reason is that !BigBlueButton ran on Ubuntu 10.04 64-bit, whereas !BigBlueButton 0.9.0 runs on Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit.  While technically you could upgrade a Ubuntu 10.04 64-bit server to run Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit, the (much) easier approach is to start with a clean server.


= Before you install =

The requirements for !BigBlueButton 0.9.0-beta are

  * Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit
  * 4 GB of memory (8 GB is better)
  * Quad-core 2.6 GHZ CPU (or faster)
  * TCP ports 80, 1935, 9123, 5066 are accessible 
  * UDP ports 16384 - 32768 are accessible
  * Port 80 is *not* used by another application
  * 500G of free disk space (or more) for recordings
  * 100 Mbits/sec bandwidth (symmetrical)

In addition to ensuring your server meets the above requirements, there are a few more checks.  First, the locale of the server must be en_US.UTF-8.  To verify , enter the following command

{{{
$ cat /etc/default/locale
LANG="en_US.UTF-8"
}}}

If you don't see `LANG="en_US.UTF-8"`, then enter the following commands.

{{{
$ sudo apt-get install language-pack-en
$ sudo update-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8
}}}

Next, logout and log back into your session (this will reload your configuration).  Run `cat /etc/default/locale` again.  Verify you see only the single line `LANG="en_US.UTF-8"`.  Note: if you see an additional line `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8`, then remove the setting for `LC_ALL` before continuing.

Check that you are running under 64-bit.

{{{
$ uname -m
x86_64
}}}

And check your version of Ubuntu is Ubuntu 14.04.  If you try to install !BigBlueButton 0.9.0-beta on any other release, it won't work.

{{{
$ cat /etc/lsb-release
DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
DISTRIB_RELEASE=14.04
DISTRIB_CODENAME=trusty
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 14.04.X LTS"
}}}

Your now ready to install !BigBlueButton.

= Installing !BigBlueButton 0.9.0-beta =

If you've already installed an earlier build, see [#Upgrading_BigBlueButton upgrading BigBlueButton 0.9.0].

If you encounter an error at any step, STOP and double-check you've entered the proper commands.  Don't continue onto the next step (you'll only compound the errors).  If you can't resolve it (use Google to search for the error messages), please see [http://bigbluebutton.org/support support options].


== 1. Update your server == 

First, ensure that you have `trusty multiverse` in your `sources.list`.  Do the following.

{{{
$ grep "multiverse" /etc/apt/sources.list
}}}

and you should see the line that has a URL to the trusty multiverse uncommented, such as

{{{
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty multiverse
}}}

or

{{{
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty main restricted universe multiverse
}}}

Don't worry if your URL is different, what's important is you see an uncommented link that contains multiverse.  If you don't, then execute the following line this repository to `sources.list`.

{{{
$ echo "deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty multiverse" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
}}}

Before proceeding further, do a dist-upgrade to ensure all the current packages on your server are up-to-date.

{{{
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
}}}

If you've not updated in a while, apt-get may recommend you reboot your server after `dist-upgrade` finishes.  Do the reboot before proceeding to the next step.



== 2. Install key for !BigBlueButton == 

You first need to give your server access to the !BigBlueButton package repository.

In a terminal window, copy and paste the following commands.

{{{
# Add the BigBlueButton key
$ wget http://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/bigbluebutton.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -

# Add the BigBlueButton repository URL and ensure the multiverse is enabled
echo "deb http://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/trusty-090/ bigbluebutton-trusty main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bigbluebutton.list
}}}

== 3.  Install ffmpeg ==
!BigBlueButton 0.9.0-beta uses ffmpeg to process recordings of a session for playback.

To install ffmpeg, create a file called `install-ffmpeg.sh` and copy and paste in the following script.

{{{
sudo apt-get install build-essential git-core checkinstall yasm texi2html libvorbis-dev libx11-dev libvpx-dev libxfixes-dev zlib1g-dev pkg-config

FFMPEG_VERSION=2.3.3

cd /usr/local/src
if [ ! -d "/usr/local/src/ffmpeg-${FFMPEG_VERSION}" ]; then
  sudo wget "http://ffmpeg.org/releases/ffmpeg-${FFMPEG_VERSION}.tar.bz2"
  sudo tar -xjf "ffmpeg-${FFMPEG_VERSION}.tar.bz2"
fi

cd "ffmpeg-${FFMPEG_VERSION}"
sudo ./configure --enable-version3 --enable-postproc --enable-libvorbis --enable-libvpx
sudo make
sudo checkinstall --pkgname=ffmpeg --pkgversion="5:${FFMPEG_VERSION}" --backup=no --deldoc=yes --default
}}}

Next, run the commands

{{{
$ chmod +x install-ffmpeg.sh
$ ./install-ffmpeg.sh
}}}

After the script finishes, check that ffmepg is installed by typing the command `ffmpeg -version`.  You should see the following

{{{
$ ffmpeg -version
ffmpeg version 2.3.3 Copyright (c) 2000-2014 the FFmpeg developers
  built on Aug 18 2014 17:35:05 with gcc 4.8 (Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1)

  libswresample   0. 19.100 /  0. 19.100
}}}


== 4.  Install !BigBlueButton == 
We're now ready to install !BigblueButton 0.9.0-beta. Type

{{{
   sudo apt-get install bigbluebutton
}}}

This single command is where all the magic happens.  This command installs *all* of !BigBlueButton's components with their dependencies.  The packaging will do all the work for you to install and configure your !BigBlueButton server.

http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bbb-images/090/090install.png

Type 'Y' and press enter to install.

If you are behind a HTTP Proxy, you will get an error from the package bbb-record-core.  You can resolve this by [#Unable_to_install_gems manually installing the gems].

If you get an error message
{{{
...... Error: FreeSWITCH didn't start 
}}}
you can ignore it as we'll do a clean restart of all the components in step 6.


== 5. Install API Demos ==

To interactively test your !BigBlueButton server, you can install a set of API demos.  

{{{
$ sudo apt-get install bbb-demo
}}}

You'll need the bbb-demo package installed if you want to join the Demo Meeting from your !BigBlueButton server's welcome page.  This is the same welcome page you see at [http://dev081.bigbluebutton.org dev081 demo server].

Later on, if you wish to remove the API demos, you can enter the command

{{{
$ sudo apt-get purge bbb-demo
}}}

== 6. Enable webRTC audio == 

To enable webRTC audio, do the following

{{{
$ sudo bbb-conf --enablewebrtc
}}}

== 7. Do a Clean Restart == 

To ensure !BigBlueButton has started cleanly, enter the following commands:

{{{
$ sudo bbb-conf --clean
$ sudo bbb-conf --check
}}}

The `--clean` option will clear out all the log files for !BigBlueButton.  The `--check` option will grep through the log files looking for errors.  

The output from `sudo bbb-conf --check` will display your current settings and, after the text, "** Potential problems described below **", print any potential configuration or startup problems it has detected. 



= Upgrading !BigBlueButton 0.9.0-beta =
As updates become available, to upgrade your !BigBlueButton 0.9.0-beta server, enter the following commands:

{{{
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

$ sudo bbb-conf --enablewebrtc
$ sudo bbb-conf --clean
$ sudo bbb-conf --check
}}}


= Troubleshooting =

If you encounter an error at one of the installation/upgrade steps,


== Run sudo bbb-conf --check ==
We've built in a !BigBlueButton configuration utility, called `bbb-conf`, to help you configure your !BigBlueButton server and trouble shoot your setup if something doesn't work right.

If you think something isn't working correctly, the first step is enter the following command.

{{{
$ sudo bbb-conf --check
}}}

This will check your setup to ensure the correct processes are running, the !BigBlueButton components have correctly started, and look for common configuration problems that might prevent !BigBlueButton from working properly.  

If you see text after the line `** Potential problems described below **`, then it may be warnings (which you can ignore if you've change settings) or errors with the setup.




Some hosting providers do not provide a complete `/etc/apt/source.list`.  If you are finding your are unable to install a package, try replacing your `/etc/apt/sources.list` with the following


{{{
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty main restricted universe multiverse
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty-updates main restricted universe multiverse
deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty-security main restricted universe multiverse

}}}

then do

{{{ 
$ sudo apt-get update
}}}

and try installing !BigBlueButton again from the beginning steps.


== Change the !BigBlueButton Server's IP ==

A common problem is the default install scripts in for !BigBlueButton configure it to list for an IP address, but if you are accessing your server via a DNS hostname, you'll see the 'Welcome to Nginx' message.

To change all of !BigBlueButton's configuration files to use a different IP address or hostname, enter

{{{
$ sudo bbb-conf --setip <ip_address_or_hostname>
}}}

For more information see [BBBConf bbb-conf options]. 

== Audio not working ==

If you are installing on EC2 or a hosting provider that has a number of network interfaces, you need to tell FreeSWITCH to listen on your external interface.
