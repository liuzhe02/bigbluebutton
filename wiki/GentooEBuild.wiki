To install BigBlueButton you need to download and install Apache-ActiveMQ and Red5 first. 
Let's start with Apache-ActiveMQ.
Go to your local repository such as {{{ /usr/portage }}} or create a local repository on your own in {{{ /usr/local/portage }}}
Create a new directory structure as following {{{ net-im/apache-activemq }}} and inside this folder create a files folder. If you are still unsure about the folder structure, look in {{{ /usr/portage }}} and choose any of the other directories and look up their structures.
