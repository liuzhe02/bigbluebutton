#summary This page contains information about displaying the content on a white board over public internet for the BigBlueButton system

= Introduction =

The white board module for the purpose of BigBlueButton is defined as the ability to show in real-time the content written/drawn on a particular white board to a remote user. A customized component designed specifically for BigBlueButton with strict guidelines such as pure mobility is what makes this unique.


= Details =

Nowadays presentations are not just limited to slides, therefore the main idea behind creating the Whiteboard module is to allow remote users to obtain the full experience as if they were attending the event in person. When the module is complete, the remote user will see a new window being updated in real-time to display what the presenter has written/drawn to the board. 

The events (presenter writing on the white board) will be captured using a Wii controller which will generate a Bluetooth signal that the computer will then take and convert to the desired format. 

There are many approaches to developing such a module. The three being considered are

 # When the Bluetooth signal is received it will be converted to Flash then sent to the Red5 server.  
 # When the Bluetooth signal is received it will be converted to Java then sent to the Red5 server. 
 # When the Bluetooth signal is received it will be converted to Java, then converted to flash then sent to the Red5 server.

= Tasks =

== To do ==

- Making a sensor bar and LED pen

== Current Items ==

- Currently, we are writing the code that which will capture the presenter's interaction through the Wiimote on a whiteboard. There are 3 aspects considered so far are

Calibration:
This is needed to specify the area of the whiteboard and is necessary for scaling and boundary issues. The current protocol for this is to have the user touch the LED pen to the four corners of the board in a specific order. This has been completed but needs testing and bulletproofing as we are waiting on the hardware.

Scaling:
Once the area of the whiteboard has been determined, the flash application will display the contents at an equivalent ratio to the board. Therefore appropriate scaling algorithms need to be written. This is were our attention is directed towards at the moment.

Displaying
Once the previous two items are completed the flash application will be able to accurately represent the lecturers intentions. Now that information has been scaled down and is within the boundaries they will appear in the window. 


- Write Actionscript for basic interface with Wiimote

== Done ==

=== Achieve connection between PC and Wiimote ===

We are now able to get the Wiimote talking to the computer and register button events coming from the Wiimote in a .swf file. 


= Connecting and Troubleshooting the Wiimote =

== Rocketfish Bluetooth 2.0 EDR USB Adapter,  Model Number : RF-FLBTAD ==

This particular Bluetooth adapter comes with a cd of drivers. These drivers have proven to not work with the Wiimote. Research into these drivers has revealed that they do not allow the Wiimote to 'pair' to the user's PC, although the Wiimote is found using the scan feature. 

The current solution has been to simply plug in the USB adapter and (if using Windows XP /2000) to allow Windows to find and install the drivers automatically. Once the drivers are installed, the Wiimote can be turned on by pressing the 1 & 2 buttons at the same time. By selecting the Bluetooth symbol that appears in the task bar the user can now select pairing options and scan for Bluetooth devices. The Wiimote should appear and once selected, it should pair to the PC.

== WiiFlash ==

Achieving a connection with the WiiFlash server software from the link noted above requires that the user hold continuously press the 1 & 2 buttons on the Wiimote while opening the server .exe, even after a Bluetooth connection to the PC has been achieved.

This is necessary due to the fact that after a short time the Wiimote goes into hibernation and WiiFlash does not see it.

It should also be noted that each time you close the Wiiflash server, it is necessary to remove the Wiimote from the list of Bluetooth devices and add it again before restarting the server.
