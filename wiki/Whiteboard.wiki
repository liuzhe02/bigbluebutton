#summary This page contains information about displaying the content on a white board over public internet for the BigBlueButton system

= Introduction =

The white board module for the purpose of BigBlueButton is defined as the ability to show in real-time the content written/drawn on a particular white board to a remote user. A customized component designed specifically for BigBlueButton with strict guidelines such as pure mobility is what makes this unique.


= Details =

Nowadays presentations are not just limited to slides, therefore the main idea behind creating the Whiteboard module is to allow remote users to obtain the full experience as if they were attending the event in person. When the module is complete, the remote user will see a new window being updated in real-time to display what the presenter has written/drawn to the board. 

The events (presenter writing on the white board) will be captured using a Wii controller which will generate a Bluetooth signal that the computer will then take and convert to the desired format. 

There are many approaches to developing such a module. The three being considered are

 # When the Bluetooth signal is received it will be converted to Flash then sent to the Red5 server.  
 # When the Bluetooth signal is received it will be converted to Java then sent to the Red5 server. 
 # When the Bluetooth signal is received it will be converted to Java, then converted to flash then sent to the Red5 server.

= Connecting and Troubleshooting the Wiimote =

== Rocketfish Bluetooth 2.0 EDR USB Adapter,  Model Number : RF-FLBTAD ==

This particular Bluetooth adapter comes with a cd of drivers. These drivers have proven to not work with the Wiimote. Research into these drivers has revealed that they do not allow the Wiimote to 'pair' to the user's PC, although the Wiimote is found using the scan feature. 

The current solution has been to simply plug in the USB adapter and (if using Windows XP /2000) to allow Windows to find and install the drivers automatically. Once the drivers are installed, the Wiimote can be turned on by pressing the 1 & 2 buttons at the same time. By selecting the Bluetooth symbol that appears in the task bar the user can now select pairing options and scan for Bluetooth devices. The Wiimote should appear and once selected, it should pair to the PC.
