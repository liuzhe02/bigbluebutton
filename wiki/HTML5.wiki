#summary Overview of plans for creating an HTML5 client for BigBlueButton

= HTML5 =

We are investigating ways to extend !BigBlueButton's infrastructure to support HTML5.

We are doing this in three phases:

  # View a recording using HTML5 (implemented in !BigBlueButton 0.80)
  # View a live session using an HTML5 browser
  # View and broadcast audio/video in a live session (requires WebRTC) 
  # Present into a live session

== Overview of Architecture ==

!BigBlueButton already provides the full client/server architecture for real-time collaboration.

By building on this platform, we can extend the architecture to enable a HTML5 client to join.  

The following diagram outlines our intended approach
