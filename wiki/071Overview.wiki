#summary This page will hold information for the 0.71-dev testing cycle

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Introduction =

We're getting close to finishing the development of !BigBlueButton 0.71-dev (and we emphasize the 'dev' as it's still in development), but we're far enough along to start testing.

This is where you can help.  

Our goal at the moment is shake out the obvious (and not so obvious) bugs in !BigBlueButton 0.71-dev so we can soon move to broader testing.  Our plan for testing 0.71-dev will proceed in stages:

  # Install 0.71-dev on devtest.bigbluebutton.org for limited testing _(done)_
  # Install 0.71-dev on demo.bigbluebutton.org for broader testing
  # Release a 0.71-dev VM for download and testing
  # Release the 0.71-dev Ubuntu packages for local installation and testing

Please read 'What's new in 0.71-dev' below and help us test and stress it by visiting the following URL: *[http://devtest.bigbluebutton.org/ http://devtest.bigbluebutton.org/]*.   

*Note:* When you find a bug, please use the [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/issues/list issue tracker] to submit a short description along with the steps to reproduce it.  We recognize that some bugs are not deterministic, but if you can provide steps, it *greatly* assists us in quickly fixing the bugs.  We'll watch the issue list closely and use it, along with the feedback in [http://groups.google.com/group/bigbluebutton-dev/topics?gvc=2 bigbluebutton-dev] to gauge our progress through the above stages.


= What's new in 0.71-dev =

While this list is not complete, here are some highlights that are ready for you to test.

== Reduced audio lag with VoIP ==

This was the bulk of our effort for 0.71.  We improved the algorithms to handle audio packets coming to and from the !BigBlueButton server.  You should experience less audio lag using VoIP when compared to 0.70.  (We'll let you judge the extent to which the lag has been reduced.)

!BigBlueButton 0.71 now supports FreeSWITCH as a voice conference server.  This enables the !BigBlueButton client to transmit either wide-band (16 KHZ) speex or nellymoser voice codec.   In our testing so far, we found that nellymoser scales better and will remain the default voice codec in !BigBlueButton.

*Test:* Open two !BigBlueButton sessions.  Join the audio in both session, but mute one of the microphones.  Using a headset, start counting 1, 2, 3, etc.  You'll hear yourself as the VoIP packages are sent to the !BigBlueButton server from one client and are received on the other.

== Auto display of user's video ==

When a user shares their webcam, it automatically opens on all other users connected to the virtual classroom.

*Test:* Open two !BigBlueButton sessions.  Share your webcam in one; a view webcam window should automatically appear in the other.


== Share a region of your desktop ==

To reduce the bandwidth usage of desktop sharing, !BigBlueButton now gives the presenter the option of selecting a rectangular region of their desktop.

When you click 'Region', the desktop sharing applet will start and display dragable and resizable selection area appears on your screen.

*Test:* Try sharing a region of your desktop with other participants.  You can also open two !BigBlueButton sessions and share your desktop from one; a view desktop window should automatically open in the others.


== Change your locale from within the client ==

The !BigBlueButton client will detect your locale and choose the associated localization strings (if available).  There is now a drop-down menu to manually choose a locale (which helps test support for other languages).  When chosen, the interface will automatically switch to that language.

*Test:* Try changing the localization setting.  If you understand the language in a different localization setting, see if the user interface strings make sense.


== Automatic translation of chat messages using Google Translate ==

When someone types you a message from a different locale, the Chat window will automatically use Google Translate to translate messages to your language.

*Test:* Try opening two !BigBlueButton sessions and change the locale  session in one.  Try typing test -- the text will be translated by Google Translate.

The chat window now shows local times for messages.
