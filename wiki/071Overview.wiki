#summary This page will hold 0.71 Information during the testing cycle

= Introduction =

This page gives you an overview of what's new in !BigBlueButton 0.71.  At the moment, you can try the latest version by using our [http://devbuild.bigbluebutton.org/ Development Build Server].


== Voice ==

We've added support for FreeSWITCH, which now enables the client to transmit wide-band speex.  We've also improved the algorithms to handle audio packets so you'll experienced less lag in the VoIP.

== Share region of your desktop ==

The share desktop button shows a preview window that enables you share your entire desktop (same as 0.70) or a selected region.

When you click 'Region', a Java applet will start and dragable selection area appears on your screen.  You can drag and resize it to select the area you want.

== Localization Drop-down ==

The !BigBlueButton client will detect your local and choose the associated localization strings (if available).  There is now a drop-down menu to choose a locale.  When chosen, the interface will automatically switch.

== Improved chat ==

The chat window now shows local times for messages.  It also uses Google Translate to translate messages between languages.

For example, a user with language set to Chinese Simplified will tell !BigBlueButton to translate incoming chat messages into Chinese Simplifed.
