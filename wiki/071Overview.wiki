#summary This page will hold information for the 0.71-dev testing cycle

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Introduction =

This page gives you an overview of what's new in !BigBlueButton 0.71-dev.  We emphasize "0.71-dev" as the development is still underway.  We're looking forward to soon moving into our testing phase.

We're far enough along for some broader testing.  There are still bugs (see note below), but at the moment you can try 0.71-dev on [http://devtest.bigbluebutton.org/ 0.71-dev Test Server].  This is the fist phase of testing.  If it goes well, the next phases will follow:

  # testing 0.71-dev on demo.bigbluebutton.org
  # releasing 0.71-dev VM for testing
  # releasing 0.71-dev packages for testing

*When you find a bug*, please post a short description along with the steps to reproduce to our [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/issues/list issue tracker].  We'll monitor the bugs closely and update them as they arrive.  Our goal is to further harden !BigBlueButton 0.71-dev for testing on demo.bigbluebutton.org next.

= What's new in 0.71-dev =

== Auto display of user's video ==

When a user shares their webcam, it automatically opens on all other users connected to the virtual classroom.

*Test:* Open two !BigBlueButton sessions.  Share your webcam in one; a view webcam window should automatically appear in the other.

== Reduced audio lag with VoIP ==

We've added support for FreeSWITCH.  This enables the !BigBlueButton client to transmit either wide-band (16 KHZ) speex or nellymoser voice codec (default).  We've also improved the algorithms to handle audio packets to reduce the audio lag for other listeners when using VoIP.

*Test:* Open two !BigBlueButton sessions.  Join the audio in both session, but mute one of the microphones.  Using a headset, start counting 1, 2, 3, etc.  You'll hear yourself as the VoIP packages are sent to the !BigBlueButton server from one client and are received on the other.

== Presenter can now share a region of of their desktop ==

To reduce the bandwidth usage of desktop sharing, !BigBlueButton now gives the presenter the option of selecting a rectangular region of their desktop.

When you click 'Region', the desktop sharing applet will start and display dragable and resizable selection area appears on your screen.

*Test:* Try sharing a region of your desktop with other participants.  You can also open two !BigBlueButton sessions and share your desktop from one; a view desktop window should automatically open in the others.


== Dynamic locale settings ==

The !BigBlueButton client will detect your locale and choose the associated localization strings (if available).  There is now a drop-down menu to manually choose a locale (which helps test support for other languages).  When chosen, the interface will automatically switch to that language.

*Test:* Try changing the localization setting.  If you understand the language in a different localization setting, see if the user interface strings make sense.


== Automatic translation of chat messages using Google Translate ==

When someone types you a message from a different locale, the Chat window will automatically use Google Translate to translate messages to your language.

*Test:* Try opening two !BigBlueButton sessions and change the locale  session in one.  Try typing test -- the text will be translated by Google Translate.

The chat window now shows local times for messages.
