= Introduction =

This page gives you an overview of what's new in !BigBlueButton 0.71-dev.  We emphasize "0.71-dev" as the development is now finishing and we are moving into our testing phase.

At the moment, you can try 0.71-dev on our [http://devbuild.bigbluebutton.org/ Development Build Server].  This is the fist phase of testing, which will follow with

  * testing 0.71-dev on demo.bigbluebutton.org
  * releasing 0.71-dev VM for testing
  * releasing 0.71-dev packages for testing

= What's new in 0.71-dev =

Please test each of these features and see if you can break them or find bugs.

*When you find a bug*, please post a short description along with the steps to reproduce to our [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/issues/list issue tracker].  We'll monitor the bugs closely and update them as they arrive.  Our goal is to further harden !BigBlueButton 0.71-dev for testing on demo.bigbluebutton.org next.

Here's a summary of what's new in 0.71-dev.  

== Video ==

When a participant shares their webcam, the video window now opens automatically on all other computers.

Test: Open two !BigBlueButton sessions.  In one, share your webcam.  Your webcam should automatically appear in the other.

== Voice ==

We've added support for FreeSWITCH, which now enables the client to transmit wide-band (16 KHZ) speex in addition to the current nellymoser voce codec.  We've also improved the algorithms to handle audio packets so you'll experienced less lag in the VoIP.

Test: Check the delay and audio quality of the other participants.  Are you able to talk normally ... try and judge the delay.  Is it 1 second, 2 second, etc.

== Share region of your desktop ==

The share desktop button shows a preview window that enables you share your entire desktop (same as 0.70) or a selected region (new in 0.71-dev).

When you click 'Region', a Java applet will start and dragable selection area appears on your screen.  You can drag and resize it to select the area you want.

Test: Try sharing a region of your desktop with other participants.  You can also open two !BigBlueButton sessions and share your desktop from one; a view desktop window should automatically open in the others.


== Localization Drop-down ==

The !BigBlueButton client will detect your local and choose the associated localization strings (if available).  There is now a drop-down menu to choose a locale.  When chosen, the interface will automatically switch.

Test: Try changing the localization setting.  If you understand the language in a different localization setting, see if the user interface strings make sense.


== Improved chat ==

The chat window now shows local times for messages.  It also uses Google Translate to translate messages between languages.

For example, a user with language set to Chinese Simplified will tell !BigBlueButton to translate incoming chat messages into Chinese Simplifed.

Test: Try opening two !BigBlueButton sessions and change the localization session in one.  Try typing test -- the text will be translated by Google Translate.
