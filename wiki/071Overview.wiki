#summary This page will hold information for the 0.71-dev testing cycle

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Introduction =

We've been working on !BigBlueButton 0.71 for a while now and, though there are still [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/issues/list?can=2&q=milestone=Release0.71 issues] for us to close, we're far enough along to start broader testing of 0.71-dev.

We've made a build of 0.71-dev available on [http://devtest.bigbluebutton.org/ 0.71-dev Test Server].   This is were you come in.  Please ready the list of what's new below and help us test and stress this build.   When you find a bug, let us know (see note below) and we'll work to fix it.

This is the fist phase of testing.  If it goes well, we'll proceed as follows:

  # testing 0.71-dev on demo.bigbluebutton.org
  # releasing a 0.71-dev VM for download and testing
  # releasing the 0.71-dev Ubuntu packages for installation and testing

Our goal at the moment is shake out the obvious bigs in !BigBlueButton 0.71-dev so we can soon move to broader testing on demo.bigbluebutton.org.

*Note:* When you find a bug, please use the [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/issues/list issue tracker] to submit a short description along with the steps to reproduce it.  We recognize that some bugs are not deterministic, but if you can provide steps, it *greatly* assists us in quickly fixing the bugs.  

= What's new in 0.71-dev =

While this list is not complete, here are some highlights that are ready for you to test.

== Reduced audio lag with VoIP ==

This was the bulk of our effort for 0.71.  We improved the algorithms to handle audio packets coming to and from the !BigBlueButton server.  You should experience less audio lag using VoIP when compared to 0.70.  (We'll let you judge the extent to which the lag has been reduced.)

!BigBlueButton 0.71 now supports FreeSWITCH as a voice conference server.  This enables the !BigBlueButton client to transmit either wide-band (16 KHZ) speex or nellymoser voice codec.   In our testing so far, we found that nellymoser scales better and will remain the default voice codec in !BigBlueButton.

*Test:* Open two !BigBlueButton sessions.  Join the audio in both session, but mute one of the microphones.  Using a headset, start counting 1, 2, 3, etc.  You'll hear yourself as the VoIP packages are sent to the !BigBlueButton server from one client and are received on the other.

== Auto display of user's video ==

When a user shares their webcam, it automatically opens on all other users connected to the virtual classroom.

*Test:* Open two !BigBlueButton sessions.  Share your webcam in one; a view webcam window should automatically appear in the other.


== Presenter can now share a region of of their desktop ==

To reduce the bandwidth usage of desktop sharing, !BigBlueButton now gives the presenter the option of selecting a rectangular region of their desktop.

When you click 'Region', the desktop sharing applet will start and display dragable and resizable selection area appears on your screen.

*Test:* Try sharing a region of your desktop with other participants.  You can also open two !BigBlueButton sessions and share your desktop from one; a view desktop window should automatically open in the others.


== Dynamic locale settings ==

The !BigBlueButton client will detect your locale and choose the associated localization strings (if available).  There is now a drop-down menu to manually choose a locale (which helps test support for other languages).  When chosen, the interface will automatically switch to that language.

*Test:* Try changing the localization setting.  If you understand the language in a different localization setting, see if the user interface strings make sense.


== Automatic translation of chat messages using Google Translate ==

When someone types you a message from a different locale, the Chat window will automatically use Google Translate to translate messages to your language.

*Test:* Try opening two !BigBlueButton sessions and change the locale  session in one.  Try typing test -- the text will be translated by Google Translate.

The chat window now shows local times for messages.
