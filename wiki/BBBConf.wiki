#summary Documentation for bbb-conf, the command-line configuration tool for BigBlueButton

= Introduction =

`bbb-conf` is a script installed when you run the !BigBlueButton virtual machine or install !BigBlueButton from packages. The `bbb-conf` script helps you modify !BigBlueButton's configuration and detect possible errors in installation.

If you are installing !BigBlueButton from source, you can download `bbb-conf` from [http://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/blob/master/bigbluebutton-config/bin/bbb-conf here].

On the VM, bbb-conf is located in `/usr/local/bin/bbb-conf`.  If you want to see what happens when you invoke `bbb-conf`, just crack open the script; you can see all the commands it executes.  Doing this will help you understand how to setup your own development environment on a different Unix OS.

= Troubleshooting =
In some cases the IP of the VM maybe change while initializing for the first time and, consequently, the !BigBlueButton config files would be setup with the wrong IP address. If you're running into problems, execute the following command. 

{{{
   bbb-conf -c
}}}

If the IP in !BigBlueButton's config files don't match the IP of your VM, you will see something like the following.

To resolve this, all you need to do is run this command:

{{{
   bbb-conf --setip <YOUR-IP>
}}}
