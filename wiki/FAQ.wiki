= Welcome =

We created this Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) guide to help you get started installing, configuring, administrating, using, and upgrading !BigBlueButton quickly.  

== I can't find my answer in this FAQ ==
If you find this FAQ does not answer your question(s), please post to one of the following mailing lists

  * For setup, instllation, and configuration questions, please post to [http://groups.google.com/group/bigbluebutton-setup/topics?gvc=2 bigbluebutton-setup]  .
  * For end user questions, please post to [http://groups.google.com/group/bigbluebutton-users/topics?gvc=2 bigbluebutton-users].
  * For all other questions, please post to [http://groups.google.com/group/bigbluebutton-dev bigbluebutton-dev].

All of the core !BigBlueButton contributions subscribe to all three mailing lists.

Please note that [http://groups.google.com/group/bigbluebutton-setup/topics?gvc=2 bigbluebutton-setup] is a recent split from [http://groups.google.com/group/bigbluebutton-dev/topics?gvc=2 bigbluebutton-dev].  Search the archives for bigbluebutton-dev and there's a good chance someone might asked your question and shared the answer. 

== Why is this project called !BigBlueButton? ==

The name comes from the goal of making setting up a virtual classroom as easy as pressing a (metaphorical) big blue button.

== Who are the core developers of !BigBlueButton? ==

The core developers are listed on the [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/ Google Code home page] for this project.   

== How do I join the !BigBlueButton development team? ==

We welcome contributions from other developers!  This is a merit-based project, which means you need to contribute for a while before you'll be granted check-in rights to the core repository.

To contribute, a good way to start is helping others in the mailing list solve their problems.  

Next, you'll need to demonstrate you are familiar with contributing to an open source project.  A good way to start is try fixing an open issue in our [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/issues/list issue tracking system], or, if you are ambitions, try implementing one of [IdeasPage open ideas] for enhancing !BigBlueButton.

Stability and usability are core to !BigBlueButton.  If you are able to help fix bugs and increase the stability and usability of the platform, we're interested in working with you 
now and in the future. 


= Installation =

== What are the minimum hardware requirements to run !BigBlueButton? ==
We recommend you run !BigBlueButton on dual core machine with at least 1 Gig of memory and a 2.0+ Ghz processor.  Any new PC you buy today will be sufficent for a !BigBlueButton server.  You'll need good upstream and downstream bandwidth from the server. 


== OS Requirements ==


=== Ubuntu ===
As of !BigBlueButton 0.64, we recommend you install and run !BigBluebutton on *Ubuntu 9.04 32-bit* OS. The [InstallationUbuntu Ubuntu packages] have been available and tested since December 2008, and with five commands you can install a full !BigBlueButton server in about fifteen (15) minutes.  Please note, that the packages have not been tested on Ubuntu 9.04 64-bit, Ubuntu 9.10 32-bit, or Ubuntu 9.10 64-bit, however, there are [InstallingBigBlueButton step-by-step instructions] for installing !BigBlueButton that you can adapt.

Work is underway in [RoadMap BigBlueButton 0.7] to support Ubuntu 10.04 32-bit and 64-bit.






=== CentOS ===
As of !BigBlueButton 0.64, we recommend you install !BigBluebutton using [RPMPackaging RPM packages] on *CentOS 32-bit and 64-bit*.  If you are running a different version of CentOS, try following the [InstallingBigBlueButtonCentOS step-by-step instructions] for installing on CentOS.

=== Windows === 
While technically it should be possible to manually install each of the individual OpenSourceComponents needed to run !BigBlueButton on Windows, we haven't tried it nor have we tested it.

Don't worry -- using [http://www.vmware.com/products/player/ VMWare Player] you can have a full !BigBlueButton server running in under an hour using the [BigBlueButtonVM BigBlueButton Virtual Machine].  The !BigBlueButton VM is running Ubuntu 9.04 32-bit and has all the components pre-installed. 

If you a brave soul and want to manually install the individual OpenSourceComponents natively on Windows and then install all the !BigBlueButton components, it should be possible. However, beware, no one who has tried this has lived to post a success message to our mailing list :-).

=== OS X ===
The easiest way to get your own !BigBlueButton server under OS X is to install VMWare Fusion and run the [BigBlueButtonVM BigBlueButton Virtual Machine].  

=== Gentoo ===
There is a !BigBlueButton Labs project (prototype and unsupported) that shows how to [GentooEBuild install BigBlueButton on Gentoo using ebuild].



== Bandwidth Requirements ==


=== What are the bandwidth requirements for running a !BigBlueButton server? ===

When sharing a webcam, as a moderator !BigBlueButton lets you select 320x240 or 640x480. Both use the same amount of bandwidth, roughly 30-50 kbytes/second per stream. 

For example, if you have a room with 5 people in it with 5 webcams then the fomula is: 

  * Y = 30-50 Kbytes/sec; let's assume 40 Kbytes/sec on average 
  * W = amount of webcams that are streaming 
  * U = amount of users that are watching 

For calculations:
  * server incoming bandwidth: W`*`Y 
  * server outgoing bandwidth: W`*`(U-1)`*`Y  (minus one since a broadcaster does not has to subscrive to his own stream) 

So with 5 ppl in a room with 5 webcams streaming you'll have; 

  * in: 5`*`40 = 200 Kbytes/sec incoming bandwidth needed to the server (e.g. 1.6 Mbit) 
  * out: 5`*`(5-1)`*`40 = 800 Kbytes/sec incoming bandwidth needed from the server (e.g. 6.4 Mbit) 
  * Total traffic used after one our: 60 mins`*`60 secs`*`(200 + 800) = 3.6 Gbyte traffic per hour 

If you'd have a typical classroom situation with 1 stream going to 30 
students in a remote learning environment: 

  * in: 1`*`40 = 40 Kbytes/sec incoming (e.g. 0.32 Mbit/sec) 
  * out: 1`*`(30-1)`*`40 = 1160 Kbytes/sec outgoing (e.g. 9.3 Mbit/sec) 
  * Total traffic used after one hour: 60 mins`*`60 secs`*`( 40 + 1160) = 4.3 
Gbyte traffic per hour 

If you'd have 10 of those classes then you server need to be able to output 
93 Mbit/sec; that's not much in a LAN but it's pretty much if you need to 
hire a server. 
Large "cafe-style chatroom" : 20 viewers, 8 people broadcasting with a 
webcam:  

  * in: 8`*`40 = 320 kbyte/sec ( 2.5 Mbit ) 
  * out: 8`*`(20-1)`*`40 = 6080 kbytes/sec ( 48.6 Mbit ) 
  * Total traffic used after one hour: 60 mins`*`60 secs`*`( 320 + 6080 ) = 23 
Gbyte traffic per hour 


Sharing slides take almost no bandwidth beyond the initial uploading/downloading of slides.  As the presenter moves to the next slide, the viewers receive a "move next slide" command in their !BigBlueButton client, and their client's loads the next slide from cache. Chat also almost no bandwidth as well.

Desktop sharing takes the most bandwidth, and it's dependent on the presenter's screen size and how often their screen updates.  

If the presenter has only 100 kilobytes/second upstream, then VoIP, video, and desktop sharing will all throttle back within that constraint.  In reality, red5/Flash does a good job of using limited bandwidth and it actually works quite well.  In the case of desktop sharing, the remote desktops will still update, just at a slower rate.




== Troubleshooting ==

=== I have an existing system and want to install BigBlueButton as a part of it ===

!BigBlueButton plays well with other systems.  If you are already running apache, you can have !BigBlueButton listen to a different port (see answer above).

Follow this guide for some good tips: http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ultimate_Server_Jaunty

=== Can I install BigBlueButton on a shared hosting server? ===
If you have a hosting account that only gives you, for example, FTP access and a cPanel interface, you will not be able to install !BigBlueButton.  !BigBlueButton requires a number of OpenSourceComponents that must be installed with root access.

=== I've installed using packages on Ubuntu 9.04 32-bit but I'm getting an error ===
Sometimes a hosted Ubuntu distribution, the hosting provider has removed the default access to packages in the multiverse.  Check

{{{
   /etc/apt/sources.list

=== I've installed BigBlueButton using the VM, but I can't access it from a browser ===
Make sure your VMWave Player (or VMWare Fusion) network settings are set to *bridged*, not NAT.  If they were set to NAT and you changed to bridged, you'll need to tell the VM to acquire a network address.  Enter the following command

{{{
  sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
}}}

Once you acquire an IP address, you need to change the !BigBlueButton configuration files to use this new IP address.  Don' worry, it's easy to do.   If your new IP address is 47.135.32.64, for example, enter the command

{{{
   sudo bbb-conf --setip 47.135.32.64
}}}



= Configuration =


== Networking ==

=== How do I change the main port for !BigBlueButton? ===

You can change the port which !BigBlueButton is accessed  using the [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/BBBConf bbb-conf tool ].


=== Can I provide external access to a !BigBlueButton server behind my firewall? ===

Yes.  A typical scenario is you have !BigBlueButton running on an internal computer behind a firewall.

First, on your firewall, you need to forward three ports to the IP address of the internal computer (the !BigBlueButton server).  These are ports 80 (HTTP), 9123 (Desktop Sharing), and 1935 (RTMP).

Here is an example of forwarded ports on the D-Link DIR-665 router (the internal ip address of the !BigBlueButton server in this case is 192.168.10.198):

[http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bbb-images/ports_example.jpg]

Next, tell !BigBlueButton it's external IP address or hostname, whichever you are using to enable users to access !BigBlueButton from outside the firewall.  Do this using the `bbb-conf` command.

{{{
bbb-conf --setip <ip_or_hostname>
}}}

If you are using an external hostname, you will need to setup the /etc/hosts file on the !BigBlueButton server to know about that name.  For example, if your !BigBlueButton server has the internal IP address of 19.168.0.10 and your firewall has a fully qualified hostname of host.domain.org, add the following line to /etc/hosts.

{{{
192.168.1.10 host.domain.org
}}}


== Classrooms ==

=== Can I run multiple virtual classrooms in a single !BigBlueButton server ===
Absolutely.  To see an example of this, check out the [http://demo.bigbluebutton.org/bigbluebutton/demo/demo3.jsp Join Courses] API example.  You can modify this demo page to setup your own branded landing page.

=== How do I setup new classrooms in !BigBlueButton? === 
If you are using Sakai, Moodle, Drupal, or other content management systems, see the list of [http://bigbluebutton.org/support integration modules].  If you are not a developer, it going to be far easier to use one of these modules to setup your own classrooms.

If you have a bit of programming skills, you create your own classrooms by modifying this [http://demo.bigbluebutton.org/bigbluebutton/demo/demo3.jsp Demo Page] on a !BigBlueButton server.

You will find `demo3.jsp` in the directory `/var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/bigbluebutton/demo/demo3.jsp`.

You can edit the following section
{{{
meeting = new HashMap<String, String>();
allMeetings.put( "ENGL-2013: Research Methods in English", meeting );	// The title that will appear in the drop-down menu
	meeting.put("welcomeMsg", 	welcome);			// The welcome mesage
	meeting.put("moderatorPW", 	"prof123");			// The password for moderator
	meeting.put("viewerPW", 	"student123");			// The password for viewer
	meeting.put("voiceBridge", 	"82013");			// The extension number for the voice bridge (use if connected to phone system)
	meeting.put("logoutURL", 	"/bigbluebutton/demo/demo3.jsp");  // The logout URL (use if you want to return to your pages)

}}}


If you are looking for an integration module that does not exist, please post a request to 
[http://groups.google.com/group/bigbluebutton-dev/topics?gvc=2 bigbluebutton-dev].


=== How do I integrate !BigBlueButton with my own server? === 

!BigBlueButton provides an [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/API API] for integration with other web-based applications.  


== How many simultaneous users can a !BigBlueButton server support? == 

The BigBlueButton community recently did a stress test of !BigBlueButton 0.64 (read: let's try to make it crash) and posted the [http://bigbluebutton.org/content/videos results] to the bigbluebutton-dev mailing list.  The results includes a [http://groups.google.com/group/bigbluebutton-dev/attach/d34f62db6296dfbd/bbb-test-1.pdf?part=4 PDF Summary Graph] for both CPU usage and bandwidth usage during the test.

In short: At the peak we had over twenty users logged into the voice conference and, through each user opening multiple browser pages, had over one hundred and sixty (160) simultaneous users logged into !BigBlueButton in a single virtual classroom.  



== How do I change the security salt? ==

To change the security salt, do the following: 
  # Generate a new Universal Unique ID (UUID) from a UUID generator such as at [http://www.somacon.com/p113.php http://www.somacon.com/p113.php]. This will give a long string of random numbers with dashes that will be used to create a checksum for each API request from an external application. 
  # Copy the string (including dashes) three places, replacing the existing security salt (if any) at each location: `/var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/bigbluebutton/demo/bbb_api_conf.jsp`, and `/var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/bigbluebutton/WEB-INF/classes/bigbluebutton.properties`. 
  # Do a clean restart of the !BigBlueButton server `sudo bbb-conf --clean`.

Note: If you are using a [http://bigbluebutton.org/support third-party plugin] to connect to !BigBlueButton, be sure to use the plug-in's administrative interface to specify the new salt.


== How do I change the maximum allowed size for uploading a presentation? ==
Right now the maximum size is 30mb. To change it, edit the file:
{{{
  /etc/nginx/sites-available/bigbluebutton 
}}}
right here 
{{{
       location /bigbluebutton { 
           proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:8080; 
           proxy_redirect     default; 
           proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For 
$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; 

        # Allow 30M uploaded presentation document. 
           client_max_body_size       30m; 
}}}



= Administration =

== How do I update !BigBlueButton to the newest version? ==
If you are running a !BigBlueButton VM or had installed !BigBlueButton using Ubuntu packages, you can upgrade to the newest stable release with the following two commands

{{{
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
}}}

If you would like to update instead to the latest version currently under development, you can do that too, but note that the development version of !BigBlueButton is often unstable, and nobody guarantees that it will work correctly. Here's how to do it:

Log into your VM, then edit `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/bigbluebutton.list` and change

{{{
#
# Repository for BigBlueButton
#
deb http://archive.bigbluebutton.org/ bigbluebutton main
}}}

to
{{{
#
# Repository for BigBlueButton
#
deb http://archive.bigbluebutton.org/dev bigbluebutton main
}}}

Do an `apt-get update/apt-get dist-upgrade` and you'll be running the latest builds.

== VM won't resolve packages when updating, or is not connected to the internet ==
If you're using VM player, please go to VM>Settings>Network Adapter and make sure it is set to Bridged, with the box underneath left unchecked. 
Also restart the networking on the VM by running the following command:
{{{
  sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
}}}





= Using !BigBlueButton =
== Desktop Sharing ==
=== What is needed to run desktop sharing? ===
!BigBlueButton uses a Java applet to capture screen updates.   This means desktop sharing works for Mac, Unix, and PC platforms.  

The presenter must have Java installed to share their desktop.  You can test if your system has Java installed using the following [http://java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml link].  To download Java for your computer, visit the [http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp Java download page.]

There are no additional requirements (beyond having Flash installed) for viewers to run !BigBlueButton and view the presenter's desktop.  
  
=== How can I make desktop sharing faster? ===
!BigBlueButton uses a lossless codec, which means remote students see a pixel-for-pixel view of the presenter's destkop.  However, if you have a 32-bit background image and show your desktop, then the desktop sharing will faithfully transmit your background image.

The main bottleneck for desktop sharing is the presenter's upstream bandwidth.  
  * Remove the 32-bit background image (replace it with a solid color is best)
  * Lower the screen dept from 32-bit to 16-bit
  
  

=== Can I share a specific window when sharing my desktop ===

Unfortunately no.  Most commercial web conferencing systems download a binary file (i.e. DLL) on windows or Mac to hook into the Windows Mirror 
Driver (to get screen event updates) and to use the Windows API calls to find the current window.  It's faster, but it isn't a solution for Unix users.

Since Flash can't view your desktop, !BigBlueButton uses a Java applet to capture and brodcast the presenter's desktop.  This way, !BigBlueButton equally support Mac, Unix, and PC users, but it restricts us to looking at the screen, not the underlying OS and a specific winodw.

A Java applet could, in theory, use JNI to connect into the Windows  subsystem to make API calls, but we're back to downloading a binary file (DLL) to enable it.  We haven't tried this yet, and unless there is a strong demand for it, we'll keep the desktop sharing solution available for all users.


== Presentations ==
=== Can I uploaded Microsoft Office 2007 documents to !BigBlueButton ? ===

!BigBlueButton uses OpenOffice 3.2 for converting Microsoft Office documents into PDF for display in BigBlueButton.  Office 2003 documents convert well; however, Office 2007 documents (such as .pptx) are problematic with OpenOffice 3.2.  

We recommend Office 2007 uses use Microsoft's free download to enable an Office 2007 user to save any document to PDF: [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=4d951911-3e7e-4ae6-b059-a2e79ed87041&displaylang=en download link].

You'll always get the best results with PDF.

=== I can't upload a presentation ===
We've noticed that on some UNIX systems, such as Linux (openSUSE 11.2 x64), when you click the 'upload presentation' button (lower left-hand of Presentation window), Flash will not let you upload a presentation.

If you encounter this problem, try the following

  # Click 'upload presentation'
  # Close the File Open dialog box
  # Click the (+) button next to the file name for the presentation (the File Open dialog box reappears).
  # Select a file to upload in the File Open dialog box
  # Click 'Open'
  # Click 'Upload'
  
These steps trigger the opening of the File Open by a user action, which seems to work better than the automatic display of the File Open dialog box when there is currently no presentation loaded.
  
  
  
== Voice Conference ==

=== Why do I hear music when I join the voice conference? ===

When you are the only person in the voice conference, you'll hear 'music on hold'.  This indicates that you've successfully joined (as opposed to hearing nothing).  Once a second listener joins, the music stops and you can talk with the other person.

=== There is an echo in the voice conference ===

When users the built-in VoIP in !BigBlueButton you want to ensure they are using headphones  or they are muted.

A common problem with echo occurs when a remote student is using a laptop.  They have activated the built-in VoIP, and their audio is coming out through the built-in speakers in the laptop and they are using the built-in microphone.  The problem is the laptop's microphone picks up the audio and then everyone hears an echo.  

To solve this problem, if you have logged in as a moderator, you can mute the student. Here's how:

  # click on the student's name in the Voice window, then 
  # click the speaker icon to the left of their name.  

This will mute the student.   If they want to speak, they can click the raise hand button to get your attention.

The best solution is ask all students to use a headset -- this will give them the best audio with no feedback.


== Chat ==

=== When I make !BigBlueButton full screen I can't enter any text into chat ===

By design, Adobe disables keyboard input of Flash applications when they go full-screen.  

This prevents the scenario where a malicious Flash application tries to 
masquerade as your desktop showing a web browser, for example, with a login 
screen to your bank account.  


= Developing for !BigBlueButton =

== Setup ==

=== Setting up the Dev environment ===
See [DevelopingBBB Developing !BigBlueButton] for full instructions.

=== Where can I download the latest build? ===
You can checkout the latest code from SVN.  If you want to install the latest build from packages, see how to [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/BigBlueButtonVM#Updating_the_BigBlueButton_VM_to_packages_on_trunk_(aka_Living_o Install from latest build].

=== I want to develop from Windows! ===
Even though the !BigBlueButton VM makes your life much easier, some people prefer to develop in their Windows environment instead. Once you have the development environment setup, you can mount the VM drive to Windows. When you launch Eclipse of Flex Builder simply create your workspace on the VM drive. This way you'll be developing in Windows with the source on the VM. Once you're ready to deploy, switch to the VM console and deploy using ant. We've found this is the easiest way to develop for !BigBlueButton.

=== How to compile and deploy the components of !BigBlueButton? ===
For most components of BBB, the source on the !BigBlueButton VM includes ant scripts which you can use to compile and deploy that particular component. If you have questions about compiling a specific component, post to the mailing list.

=== What if I want to develop for the Client only? ===
If you are just working on the client side, you need to edit the file config.xml (located in the src/conf folder) to point to a running instance of !BigBlueButton. Change all the IP addresses in the file to the IP of your BBB server or BBB VM. In the entry for the Viewers Module, change the attribute host to host="conf/join-mock.xml". This will enable you to launch and test the client directly from the Flex environment, bypassing the Web component of !BigBlueButton.

You need to create the following 2 directories on your bbb server if they're not already there: /var/bigbluebutton/conference-mock-default/room-mock-default and change the owner to tomcat6:tomcat6 (chown -R tomcat6.tomcat6 /var/bigbluebutton/conference-mock-default) 

=== My client fails at startup with RSL error; Error 2035:URL Not Found ===
This is related to localization. Before you launch your client, you need to first separately run the ant localization task. This task is included in your client directory in the build.xml file. It needs to run separately because otherwise java will run out of memory if all tasks are ran together. You can run the localization task from the command line or from Flex if you've set up ant to work with Flex Builder. You can find instructions on how to get Ant working with Flex [http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/help.html?content=anttasks_1.html here]

=== Where is the !BigBlueButton scheduling interface in 0.63 ===

In !BigBlueButton 0.63, we are depreciating the grails web 
interface to schedule meetings in favor of using the !BigBlueButton 
API.  We [http://demo.bigbluebutton.org/bigbluebutton/demo/demo1.jsp provided examples] of using the !BigBlueButton API to show you how to use it.  
   

= Troubleshooting =

== General ==

=== I've started a new !BigBlueButton VM but I don't know the password to login via SSH ===
When the VM first asks you to change the password, you will need to enter the password 'default' twice before it lets you change to a new password. Many people miss this. Try logging in with 'firstuser' - 'default' again.

=== I can join the voice conference but nothing appears on the Voice participant's window? ===
 * Make sure {{{/usr/share/red5/webapps/bigbluebutton/WEB-INF/bigbluebutton.properties}}} values matches those with {{{/etc/asterisk/manager.d/bigbluebutton.conf}}}
 * Make sure {{{enabled = yes}}} in {{{/etc/asterisk/manager.conf}}}
 * See if changing {{{bindaddr = 0.0.0.0}}} to {{{bindaddr = 127.0.0.1}}} works.

=== I can't join the voice conference? When I click on the headset icon, nothing happens? ===
To figure out what the problem is:
 * look at the [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/ConfigurationFiles#/usr/share/red5/log/sip.log sip.log] and look for errors.
 * Open up asterisk console {{{sudo asterisk -vvvvvvr}}} and then try clicking on the headset icon on the client again. Look at the logs on the asterisk console for clues.

 * Make sure [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/source/browse/trunk/bbb-voice/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/bigbluebutton-sip.properties /usr/share/red5/webapps/sip/WEB-INF/bigbluebutton-sip.properties] (startRtpPort and stopRtpPort) has entries in [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/source/browse/trunk/bbb-voice-conference/config/asterisk/bbb_sip.conf /etc/asterisk/bbb_sip.conf]
 * Make sure your conference number is at least 5-digits as defined by {{{exten => _XXXX.,n,Konference(${EXTEN},H)}}} in [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/source/browse/trunk/bbb-voice-conference/config/asterisk/bbb_extensions.conf /etc/asterisk/bbb_extensions.conf] 

=== All I get is a "Welcome to Nginx" screen" ===
If bbb-conf -c returns:
{{{
** Potential Problems **
                        nginx (conf): no symbolic link in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled for bigbluebutton
}}}
Then you need to add a symbolic link to nginx. Try the following:
{{{
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/bigbluebutton /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/bigbluebutton
sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart
}}}


=== I have 2 microphones and want to choose with which to join the voice conference ===
When you're inside the client, righclick, go to settings > microphone icon > select microphone, and talk to see if it works by checking the volume bar.

=== When I try to join the conference, I get logged out after loading the modules ===
* Check if !BigBlueButton was ablt to connect to Asterisk AMI. Open {{{/usr/share/red5/log/bigbluebutton.log}}} and check for errors that has "login to AMI".
* Make sure that red5/webapps/bigbluebutton is running properly. Try tailing {{{tail -f /usr/share/red5/log/bigbluebutton.log}}} and try joining again. Look for clues in the resulting log.

=== My slides upload but never finish converting! ===
Try restarting tomcat6, and then red5. On Ubuntu:
{{{
sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat6 restart
sudo /etc/init.d/red5 restart
}}}


=== bbb-conf --check reports Host IP does not match !BigBlueButton ===

In !BigBlueButton 0.63, this is really more of a warning than an error.  If you are using a DNS name, and that DNS name resolves to the IP address, or you have an external DNS name that is port forwarded to !BigBlueButton, you can safely ignore the warning.

=== UTF characters won't display correctly in the Client ===
If you're using Linux, UTF characters won't display correctly. This is a Flash limitation and unfortunately there's not much we can do about it.



=== Which log files should I check for errors?  ===
Log and configuration file information can be found [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/ConfigurationFiles here]


=== How to access the red5 directory on the VM ===
You might want access to the red5 directory on the Virtual Machine. The following commands will share a shortcut to the red5 folder into your dev directory.

In /usr/share/red5
  sudo chmod go+w log
  sudo chown -R firstuser *

In /home/firstuser/dev
  ln -s /usr/share/red5 red5

== Other Questions ==
=== When will feature X be supported? ===
Check out the RoadMap, search the [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/issues/list issue tracker], or ask the [http://groups.google.com/group/bigbluebutton-dev dev mailing list]. The more people ask for an issue, the faster it'll get done. So go ahead and ask


=== How can I donate or help the project ===
The !BigblueButton project doesn't take donations. If you'd like to help, spread the word about BBB. Blog about us, follow us on [http://twitter.com/bigbluebutton twitter]. If you're a developer and want a contribute, write to the [http://groups.google.com/group/bigbluebutton-dev/ bigbluebutton-dev] mailing list.

=== How do I change the brand of !BigBlueButton? ===
There have been a number of companies (and individuals) posting to the
mailing list asking for help in branding !BigBlueButton.  

However, there are lot of places in the code that need to be manually changed (and
tested) to get everything right, and these manual changes would need
to be updated (and tested anew) for each new version of !BigBlueButton that
is released every 6-8 weeks.

The (increasing) effort to support everyone's branding efforts taking resources away from working on the core of !BigBlueButton's development.  We think everyone would like to see the core development efforts continue to grow.

There is work underway to make
it easier for people to brand !BigBlueButton by offering a commercially
supported branding tool (from Blindside Networks).  This tool would enable companies/individuals to configure their brand and brand elements in !BigBlueButton, and the tool would be updated with each release so branding a new
version of !BigBlueButton would take almost no effort.  

For the community, this would remove the inevitable problems that are going to arise when manual code changes break and flood of forum posts ensue with the title "My
branding changes no longer work -- please help me!!"

Most importantly for everyone, the efforts to provide a commercially
supported branding tool for !BigBlueButton won't take away from core
development, but rather it will support it.

Please check your webcam driver and update it if possible.



=== Is the scheduling interface in bbb-web still supported? ===

As of !BigBlueButton 0.63, we started transitioning away from the grails-based interface for scheduling conferences, located at http://ip/bigbluebutton.  We've found that most of our developers want to integrate !BigBlueButton into their application, so we've shifted focus to the !BigBlueButton API.

There are also some legacy stuff in the bbb-web interface, such as limiting the number of users, that is not implemented yet and we'll be properly implementing in the API.  

It may be in the future that the bbb-web interface is reborn and becomes a reference implementation of how to use the API, but we're currently focusing on providing examples through .jsp pages, which are much more portable and brandable for our users.
