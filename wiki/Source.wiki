#summary How to check out the source of BigBlueButton.

== Checkout Source ==
!BigBlueButton source code is hosted on [https://github.com/bigbluebutton GitHub]. You can check it out using git by running the following command on your command line in Linux:
{{{
git://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton.git
}}}

== Download Source ==
If you don't want to checkout the source using git, you can download it from the [http://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton project webpage] on !GitHub.

== Git? What the hell is that ==
If you're not familiar with Git, here's a really good [http://progit.org/book/ free book]. The !GitHub website has very detailed [http://help.github.com/ help pages] as well.

== Looking for the pre-0.70 source? ==
You can checkout the older source from here:

{{{
svn checkout http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ bigbluebutton-read-only
}}}

We have deleted the code in the repository to ensure there was no confusion between two repositories.  But you can easily revert to previous version of the repository to get access to all the pre-0.70 source.
