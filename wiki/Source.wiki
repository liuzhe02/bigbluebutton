#summary How to check out the source of BigBlueButton.

== Checkout Source ==
As of !BigBlueButton 0.70 the we host the source code on [https://github.com/bigbluebutton GitHub]. 

== Download Source ==
If you don't want to checkout the source using git, you can download it from the [http://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton project webpage] on !GitHub.

== What is Git? ==
If you're not familiar with Git, here's a really good [http://progit.org/book/ free book]. The !GitHub website has very detailed [http://help.github.com/ help pages] as well.

== Looking for the pre-0.70 source? ==
You can checkout the older source from here:

{{{
svn checkout http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ bigbluebutton-read-only
}}}

We have deleted the code in the repository to ensure there was no confusion between GitHub (where all latest development is occurring) and the out-of-date svn.  But you can easily revert to previous version of the repository to get access to all the pre-0.70 source.
