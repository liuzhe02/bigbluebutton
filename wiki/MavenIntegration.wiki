#summary Instructions to build with Maven

= Introduction =

One of our ongoing goals is to make it easier for other developers to build, extend, and help improve !BigBlueButton.

Currently, !BigBlueButton uses different build systems (ant and gradel) with the requirement of using the VM for development.  To make it easier to build, we are working on moving to a unified build system using maven 3.

You can try building !BigBlueButton using the following instructions.
