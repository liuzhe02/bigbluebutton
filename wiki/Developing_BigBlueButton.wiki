#summary How to develop BigBlueButton.

*NOTE*
This is still a draft. We will finalize this when we release 0.62. If you run into problems, please post to the mailing list.

We primarily develop on Windows with BBB running on VMWare. This page will describe how we setup our development environment for !BigBlueButton.

= Get BBB VM running =
 * Follow the instructions to download and start BBB here http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/BigBlueButtonVM
 * Make sure you can join to the default conference (85115) and everything works.

= Setup Development Environment =

First, if you are using Windows, you'll want to share your development directory.

{{{
  bbb-conf --setup-samba
}}}

== To develop on !BigBlueButton Web (grails application) ==

To setup a development environment for bbb-web, enter the following command

{{{
  bbb-conf --setup-dev bbb-web
}}}

This won't replace the existing bbb-web package; rather, it will let you run bbb-web as a stand alone grails application.  Before your run bbb-web standalone, you need to stop tomcat.  

{{{
  sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat6 stop
}}}

To compile and run bbb-web, do the following

{{{
  cd ~/dev/bbb-web
  ant
}}}

== To develop on !BigBlueButton Client (Flex application) ==

To setup a development environment for bbb-web, enter the following command

{{{
  bbb-conf --setup-dev bbb-client
}}}

Like bbb-web, this won't overwrite the existing bbb-client package; rather, it will let you develop in the `~/dev/bbb-client` directory.

To compile bbb-client, do the following

{{{
  cd ~/dev/bbb-client
  ant
}}}

This will create a folder called `~/dev/bbb-client/bin` which contains the latest client.

Now, to run the client, you can just open your web browser, enter the URL for your computer (or VM), and when you load the web client, you'll be loading the client from `~/dev/bbb-client/bin`.

This works because `bbb-conf --setup-dev bbb-client` changed the location for `/client` from `/var/www/bigbluebutton-client` to `/home/firstuser/dev/bbb-client/`.



= Setup Development Environment =

 * To setup your development environment we've included some helper scripts. Type
{{{
  $ bbb-setupdev -s
}}}

This script will setup samba (Unix implementation of windows file sharing) to let you access files in firstuser from within Windows or Mac.

 * Map /home/firstuser into a windows drive (e.g. Z:)
 * Now you'll have access to the directory from your windows machine.
 * From a shell, remove all BBB pacakges. You can list them by yping
{{{
dpkg -l | grep bbb
}}}

which will list the bbb packages
{{{
rc  bbb-apps                          0.35.0-1ubuntu113                         Red5 applications for BigBlueButton
ii  bbb-apps-deskshare                0.4.0-1ubuntu53                           Red5 applications for BigBlueButton deskshar
ii  bbb-apps-sip                      0.5.0-1ubuntu14                           Red5 applications for BigBlueButton SIP modu
ii  bbb-apps-video                    0.5.0-1ubuntu8                            Red5 applications for BigBlueButton Video mo
ii  bbb-config                        0.4.0-1ubuntu63                           Configuration setup for BigBlueButton

}}}

 * To remove, type e.g. {{{apt-get remove bbb-apps}}}
 * Create a dev directory in /home/firstuser/dev
 * Check out bbb-client, bbb-apps, bbb-sip, bbb-video, bbb-deskshare
 * Import bbb-client int !FlexBuilder
 * Import the other projects into Eclipse
 
= Developing the Client =
 * The generated files for bbb-client will be in bbb-client/bin
 * Create a directory /var/www/client-dev
 * Create a softlink under /var/www/client-dev/client to point to /home/firstuser/dev/client/bin
{{{
 ln -s /home/firstuser/dev/client/bin /var/www/client-dev/client 
}}}
 * Edit {{{/etc/nginx/sites-available/bigbluebutton}}} to use the dev bbb-client
{{{
        location /client {
                root    /var/www/client-dev;
                index  index.html index.htm;
        }
}}}
 * Now your development client will be picked up when you point your browser to 
{{{
http://<yourhost>/client/BigBlueButton.html
}}}

= Developing bbb-apps, bbb-sip, bbb-video, bbb-deskshare =
 * Edit the build.properties for each project modify red5.home to point to the red5 install directory
{{{
  red5.home = /usr/share/red5
}}}
 * For each project, run {{{ant resolve}}} to download all dependencies.
 * For each project, run {{{ant deploy}}} to deploy the apps to Red5
 * Start Red5
 * If everything goes well, you should be able to join the default conference.

= Developing bbb-web =
 * Check out bbb-web into /home/firstuser/dev
 * Stop tomcat 
{{{
 /etc/init.d/tomcat6 stop
}}}
 * in {{{/home/firstuser/dev/bbb-web}}}, run 
{{{
 grails run-app
}}}
 * You should now be using bbb-web when you point your browser to
{{{
