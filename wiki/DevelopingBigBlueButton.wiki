#summary Setting up development environment.

= Introduction =

First, make sure you can run !BigBlueButton by following the instructions [HowToInstallBigBlueButton here].

Once you got that working, let's configure your development environment.

 1. Make sure you have created JAVA_HOME environment variable.
 1. Create a directory where you want the built Red5/!BigBlueButton will be deployed. For example, {{{c:\red5}}} and create and environment variable called RED5_HOME pointing to this directory.
 1. Install Ant [http://ant.apache.org] and create an ANT_HOME environment variable.
 1. Download Eclipse IDE for Java Developers from [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/]
 1. Download Flex Builder Eclipse Plugin from [https://www.adobe.com/cfusion/tdrc/index.cfm?product=flex]. You need to create an account if you don't have one. You may also install the standalone Flex Builder available at the Adobe website.
 1. Install subclipse from [http://subclipse.tigris.org/ Subclipse] website. The instruction to install can be found [http://subclipse.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectProcess?pageID=p4wYuA here].
 1. Switch to Subclipse Perspective in Eclipse. Click anywhere inside the SVN Repository window to create a new repository location. Enter {{{http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/}}} as the repository location.
 1. Checkout bigbluebutton-apps, bigbluebutton-server, bigbluebutton-client, and bigbluebutton-servlet using this [http://subclipse.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectProcess?pageID=rr1TIx instruction] from subclipse.

= Building !BigBlueButton =
== !BigBlueButton Server ==
 1. Switch Eclipse to Java perspective. Open build.xml under bigbluebutton-server within eclipse. On the Outline Window, right-click on {{{retrieve}}} and choose {{{Run As -> Ant Build}}}. This will resolve all library dependencies for bigbluebutton-server.
 1. When successful, right-click on {{{deploy}}} and choose {{{Run As -> Ant Build}}}. This will compile and deploy bigbluebutton-server into the {{{RED5_HOME}}} directory you created above.
 1. When successful, right-click on {{{publish}}} and choose {{{Run As -> Ant Build}}}.  This will publish the red5.jar into your local ivy library so that bigbluebutton-apps will be able to get the jar file as dependency.

== !BigBlueButton Apps
 1. Open build.xml under bigbluebutton-apps within eclipse. On the Outline Window, right-click on {{{resolve}}} and choose {{{Run As -> Ant Build}}}. This will resolve all library dependencies for bigbluebutton-apps.
 1. When successful, right-click on {{{deploy}}} and choose {{{Run As -> Ant Build}}}. This will compile and deploy bigbluebutton-apps into the {{{RED5_HOME}}} directory you created above.

== !BigBlueButton Servlet ==
 1. Open build.xml under bigbluebutton-servlet within eclipse. On the Outline Window, right-click on {{{create-warfile}}} and choose {{{Run As -> Ant Build}}}. This will create {{{bigbluebutton.war}}} inside bigbluebutton-servlet/dist.

== Starting !BigBlueButton ==
 1. Open a command window, cd to your ActiveMQ install from instruction [HowToInstallBigBlueButton here].
 1. Open another command window, cd to Tomcat and deploy {{{bigbluebutton.war}}} that was generated when you compiled {{{bigbluebutton-servlet }}} above following instruction [HowToInstallBigBlueButton here].
 1. Open a command window and cd to your {{{RED5_HOME}}} directory. Run {{{red5.bat}}} to start bigbluebutton-server.

== Starting the Client ==
 1. From Eclipse, right-click on {{{bigbluebutton-client}}} and choose {{{Run As -> Flex Application}}}. This will start the client where you can login into a conference.
