= Improved Audio =

There were two main goals to improving the audio
  # Improve overall sound quality
  # Increase likelihood user has a functioning microphone

== Listen Only Audio ==

Users now have the ability to choose to join the session with their microphone or listen only, which will skip permission prompts and join the audio right away).

Joining via listen only audio also reduces the CPU load on the server as !BigBlueButton sends a shared stream to all listen-only users.

== Highlight the Browserâ€™s Request For Permission == 
 
A common issue with Chrome 36 (and earlier versions) was the users would sometimes miss Chrome's prompt for permissions to access their microphone.  If the user doesn't give permission, their microphone wil not work.

!BigBlueButton 0.9.0 now provides users with prompts that highlight browser's request for permissions to access their microphone.

Here's how the dialog looks in Chrome:

And here is the FireFox version:

== Audio Test ==

Once the user has given permission, !BigBlueButton will enable the user to test their microphone by saying a few words.  The user is actually placed in an "echo test" room where their audio will be sent to the server and back to their speakers.

This steps serves two functions:
  # It emphasizes the need to have a headset for best audio experience
  # It ensures they have a functioning microphone _before_ entering the voice bridge for the session.

In most cases, the default microphone chosen by the operating system is a functioning microphone.

If the user clicks 'Yes', they are joined into the audio bridge with their default microphone using WebRTC audio (FireFox and Chrome)

== Microphone Chooser ==

If the user clicks 'No', they are brought to a new dialog to connect via Flash and choose a microphone.  This dialog is larger than the built-in dialog for Flash.

Here the user gets immediate feedback on whether the current microphone is generating energy.

If they click 'Next', they can return to the Audio Test to confirm their microphone is working before joining the session.

If the user is unable to get their microphone to work, they can always join Listen Only.  This lets other users in the session know upfront the user can only hear the session.


= Star/Stop Recording =
Moderators can now choose the segments of their session that are recorded by clicking the Stop/Start Recording button.

To help ensure that moderators do not forget to start recording their session, !BigBlueButton will remind them, after they join the audio bridge, they they can record the meeting.

== Lock Viewers ==
The moderator now has the ability to lock (restrict) viewers from having the following abilities:

  # Webcam
  # Microphone
  # Public Chat
  # Private Chat
  # Layout

== UTF-8 presentation file names now displayed ==
