The following sections gives you some visuals of the new features.  You can try them yourself by visiting the [http://demo.bigbluebutton.org/ BigBlueButton Demo Server].  Use Mozilla's !FireFox browser or Google's Chrome browser to experience the WebRTC audio.


= Improved Audio =

There were two main goals to improving the audio
  # Improve overall sound quality
  # Increase likelihood user has a functioning microphone

== Option for Listen Only Audio ==

Users now have the ability to choose to join the session with their microphone or Listen Only, which will skip permission prompts and join the audio right away).

Joining via Listen Only audio also reduces the CPU load on the server as !BigBlueButton sends a shared stream to all listen-only users.

== Highlight the Browserâ€™s Request For Permission == 
 
A common issue with Chrome 36 (and earlier versions) was the users would sometimes miss Chrome's prompt for permissions to access their microphone.  If the user doesn't give permission, their microphone wil not work.

!BigBlueButton 0.9.0 now provides users with prompts that highlight browser's request for permissions to access their microphone.

Here's how the dialog looks in Chrome:

And here is the !FireFox version:

== Audio Test ==

Once the user has given permission, !BigBlueButton will enable the user to test their microphone by saying a few words.  The user is actually placed in an "echo test" room where their audio will be sent to the server and back to their speakers.

This steps serves two functions:
  # It emphasizes the need to have a headset for best audio experience
  # It ensures they have a functioning microphone _before_ entering the voice bridge for the session.

http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bbb-images/090/aduiotest.png

In most cases, the default microphone chosen by the operating system is a functioning microphone.

If the user clicks 'Yes', they are joined into the audio bridge with their default microphone using WebRTC audio (FireFox and Chrome) 

http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bbb-images/090/webrtcaudio.png

Compared with Flash Aduio, WebRTC audio uses UDP for transmission and is encoded using OPUS.  The browser transmits audio directly to FreeSWITCH.  The browser's acoustic echo cancellation is better than Flash, and both browsers support auto-leveling of that audio, removing the need for the user to manually adjust the sensitivity.  WebRTC audio is transmitted securely via SRTP at a rate of 48 Khz, whereas speex is transmitted via RTMP (not encrypted) at a rate of 16 khz.

Overall, WebRTC should provide the user a higher quality and lower latency audio transmission.

== Microphone Chooser ==

If the user clicks 'No', they are brought to a new dialog to connect via Flash and choose a microphone.  This dialog is larger than the built-in dialog for Flash.

http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bbb-images/090/flashchoose.png

Here the user gets immediate feedback on whether the current microphone is generating energy.

If they click 'Next', they can return to the Audio Test to confirm their microphone is working before joining the session.

If the user is unable to get their microphone to work, they can always join Listen Only.  This lets other users in the session know upfront the user can only hear the session.


= Start/Stop Recording =
Moderators can now choose the segments of their session that are recorded by clicking the Stop/Start Recording button.

http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bbb-images/090/startstop.png

To help ensure that moderators do not forget to start recording their session, !BigBlueButton will remind them, after they join the audio bridge, they they can record the meeting.

= Lock Viewers =
The moderator now has the ability to lock (restrict) viewers from having the following abilities:

  # Webcam
  # Microphone
  # Public Chat
  # Private Chat
  # Layout

= Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit =

!BigBlueButton 0.9.0 now installs on Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit.  

Compared with Ubuntu 10.04 64-bit (the distribution for 0.81), Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit gives !BigBlueButton a number of significant updates to the underlying packages.  

|| *Package* || *0.81* || *0.9.0* ||
|| tomcat || 6.0.24 || 7.0.52 ||
|| javaJDK || 1.6.0_27 || 1.7.0_55 ||
|| redis || 2.2.4 || 2.8.4 ||
|| ruby || 1.9.2p290 || 1.9.3p484 ||
|| nginx || 0.7.65 || 1.4.6 ||
|| !LibreOffice || 4.0.2 || 4.2.4 ||

The installation instructions have simplified: with !Ubuntu 10.04 64-bit, administrators don't need to manually install ruby or LibreOffice -- both are now well supported in Ubuntu's packaging.

Other notable updates include

|| *Component* || *0.81* || *0.9.0* ||
|| FreeSWITCH || 1.5.1b || 1.5.14b ||
|| swftools || 0.9.1 || 0.9.2 ||
|| ffmpeg || 2.1.4 || 2.3.3 ||
|| red5 || 1.0.2 || 1.0.3 ||

Most notable has been the upgrade to FreeSWITCH, which now enabled !BigBlueButton to support WebRTC audio calls from the browser (Chrome and FireFox), while still remaining backward compatible with audio calls from Chrome and IE (via red5phone).

To start (and restart) the recording a playback scripts and LibreOffice headless, !BigBlueButton 0.9.0 now uses monit instead of god.


= Other Improvements =

== Chat supports pasting in XML ==

Users can now paste XML content into the chat window and !BigBlueButton will properly display it. 

http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bbb-images/090/xml-chat.png

This will assist sessions that are covering HTML design or XML content -- example of which can be shared by users in the chat.

== UTF-8 presentation file names now displayed ==
When the presenter uploads a presentation with a UTF-8 file name, !BigBlueButton now properly displays the file name in the upload dialog box.

== Moderators can raise hand == 
Moderators can now raise their hand. 
http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bbb-images/090/moderatorraisehand.png

== Presenters can use enter in text tool == 
When typing into the presentation using the text tool, pressing the enter key now puts in a new line instead of submitting the text.
