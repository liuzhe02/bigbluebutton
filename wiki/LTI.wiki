#summary BigBlueButton LTI implementation.


= Overview =

The *bbb-lti* component is an external service that enables a BigBlueButton server to act as a Learning Tools Interoperability ([http://developers.imsglobal.org/ LTI]) Tool in any Learning Management System (LMS) supporting the LTI standard.

Example LTI compliant LMSs are Moodle, Sakai, Canvas and Blackboard. A full list can be found in the [http://www.imsglobal.org/cc/statuschart.cfm IMS Interoperability Conformance Certification Status].


= Launching links =

LMS implementing LTI offers to privileged users (i.e. Faculty, Mentor, Administrator, Instructor ) the possibility of creating links to external tools that can be included as resources for a context and used by all the users with access to it.

The links provide single sign on (SSO) capability to users holding an account in the LMS.

When privileged users (i.e. Faculty, Mentor, Administrator, Instructor) make use of the launching link they will join a meeting into the corresponding BigBlueButton server in the role of Moderators.  Unprivileged users (i.e. Student, Learner) will join in the role of Attendees.


= LMS configuration =

There are three values required from Chalk&Wire for configuration of the Basic LTI tool:

    Launch URL    e.g. http://demo.bigbluebutton.org/lti/tool.xml
    Key           e.g. bbb
    Secret        e.g. welcome


It is recomended that the privacy settings are set to public to allow the LMS for sending lis_person_sourcedid and lis_person_contact_email_primary. These parameters are going to be used for the user identification once logged into the BigBlueButton session. If none of them is sent by default a generic name is going to be used (Attendee for attendees, Moderator for moderators).
