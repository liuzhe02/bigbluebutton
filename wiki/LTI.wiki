#summary Overview of BigBlueButton Learning Tools Interoperability support


= Overview =

!BigBlueButton 0.81 now provides support for IMS Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) (see [http://www.imsglobal.org/cc/detail.cfm?ID=172 conformance details]).

To support LTI, version 0.81 adds a new package called `bbb-lti`.  You can add LTI support by installing this package on a !BigBlueButton 0.81 server.

{{{
   sudo apt-get install bbb-lti
}}}

Specifically, this module enables your !BigBlueButton server to become and LTI tool, which can now receive and validate incoming launch requests from an LTI consumer.  

In other words, any certified LTI consumer -- such as Desire2Learn, BlackBoard, Pearson Learning Studio, etc. -- can now provide integrated real-time collaboration using !BigBlueButton. See [http://www.imsglobal.org/cc/statuschart.cfm IMS Interoperability Conformance Certification Status] for a full list of LTI compliant systems.


= Configuring !BigBlueButton as an External Tool =

All LTI consumers have the ability to launch to !BigBlueButton, usually configuring !BigBlueButton as an external tool.

To configure an external tool in the LTI consumer, you need to provide three pieces of information: URL, customer identifier, and shared secret.

After installing the `bbb-lti` package, you can use the command `bbb-conf --lti` to retrieve these values.  For example,

{{{
$ bbb-conf --lti

       URL: http://test-install.blindsidenetworks.com/lti/tool.xml
  Customer: bbb
    Secret: b00be971feb0726fa697671c9cf2e883

  Icon URL: http://test-install.blindsidenetworks.com/lti/images/icon.ico
}}}

Note: These the above values are valid for testing.  The values on your !BigBlueButton server will be different.

In the external tool configuration, we recommend privacy settings are set to *public* to allow the LMS to send lis_person_sourcedid and lis_person_contact_email_primary.  The `bbb-lti` module will use these parameters for user identification once logged into the BigBlueButton session.  If none of them is sent by default a generic name is going to be used (Viewer for viewer and Moderator for moderator).

 
= Launching !BigBlueButton as an External Tool =

The LTI launch request passes along the user's role (, which `bbb-lti` will map to the two roles in !BigBlueButton: moderator or viewer.

If no role information is given, or if the role is privileged (i.e. . Faculty, Mentor, Administrator, Instructor, etc.), then when `bbb-lti` receives a valid launch request, it will start a BigBlueButton session and join the user as *moderator*.  In all other cases, the user will join as a *viewer*.


== Custom Parameters ==

The `bbb-lti` module also accepts a number of custom parameters.  

|| Parameter || Type || Description ||
|| record || Boolean || Record meeting (default is false) ||
|| welcome || Text || Welcome message that appears in chat dialog (default is the global welcome message on the !BigBlueButton server) ||
