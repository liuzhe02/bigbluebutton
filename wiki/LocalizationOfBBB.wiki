#summary How to localize BigBlueButton

= Contributing the new language translation to !BigBlueButton =
If you would like to translate !BigBlueButton to another language, here are the steps you can follow:

  # Download the [http://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/raw/master/bigbluebutton-client/locale/en_US/bbbResources.properties language template file]. 
  # Open this file with a text editor, and translate the english text into your language.
  # Post the translated text to the [http://groups.google.com/group/bigbluebutton-dev/topics?gvc=2 BigBlueButton Mailing List]
*NOTE: While you will be credited bellow for the translation, by sending the translation to the mailing list you are automatically transferring all copyright of the translation file to the !BigBlueButton project.*

DJP, one of the !BigBlueButton developers, will download and incorporate the language file into the latest build on your behalf. Once it's checked into the repository, you'll be able to test it on our [http://devbuild.bigbluebutton.org/ Developer Build Server], which becomes the basis for the next release.

== Technical Background  ==

!BigBlueButton localization follows the i18n standard. !BigBlueButton Client will detect the locale of the language of the browser running it and attempt to load that language file. 

Language files are compiled into swf files and loaded dynamically based on the browser locale. This reduces the size of the client. Language codes follow the convention of a two letter lowercase language name, followed by an underscore, followed by two upper-case latters signifying the country code. So for example the default english for the United States would be: *en_US*

== Compiling your own language files into your client ==
If you created a custom language file but do not wish to contribute back to the project, here are the instructions on how to compile the language files yourself.


  #  Put the template file into a new folder. The folder name should follow the language code convention stated above for the language/country the language file is written for. Put the folder under bigbluebutton-client/locale.
  # The file will be loaded whenever the user's broswer is set to that language/country code. Optionally, you could overwrite the english language files if you think that most of your users are running english language broswers, but would still like them to load a specific language.

  # Finally you will need to edit the build.xml file in the bigbluebutton-client root directory. Edit AVAILABLE_LOCALES to include your language files. Just follow the examples already there. 

{{{
   <property name="AVAILABLE_LOCALES" value="az_AZ,de_DE,el_GR,en_US,es_ES,es_LA,fr_FR,hu_HU,it_IT,lt_LT,nb_NO,nl_NL,pl_PL,pt_BR,pt_PT,ro_RO,ru_RU,tr_TR,vi_VN,zh_CN,zh_TW"/>
}}}

Once you are done editing the file, you can rebuild the client. Go to the client source directory - on the VM usually /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client/, and run the command

{{{
   ant localization
}}}

To have the client load your locale, you need to add it to the locales.xml located in resources/prod folder.

Refer to the [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/FAQ#My_client_fails_at_startup_with_RSL_error;_Error_2035:URL_Not_Fo FAQ] if you have problems with Ant and Flex

== Testing your localization  ==
There is a Firefox plug-in, "Quick Locale Switcher", that can be used for testing the localizations. The plug-in is available [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1333 here]. When this plug-in is installed, you will have a menu at the bottom right hand corner that allows you to change the locale in the browser.
