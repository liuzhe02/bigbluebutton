#summary One-sentence summary of this page.
This a dreaft for the BigBlueButton API partitioning  development, it contains material related to that issue such as design and progress.  

= Introduction =

In this page we are going to describe the design of the BigBlueButton API and the progress for its development. 

The goal for that part of the API development is to enable Third Party application to call the BigBlueButton modules separately. Example of that is, calling chat module or presentation module and enable Third Party application s to to access functionalities related to the loaded modules. 


= Details =

== The API Architecture ==

*Use cases:*

This section rperesents the use cases for using the API 
Load only one BBB module (i.e. load chat module or voice, etc) when a 3rd party application starts. Green: done with calling one module (Start/Stop), display the module in a single module within the BBB canvas. 
Load more than one BBB module (i.e. chat & video, chat & presentation) when 3rd party application starts. (Green: Load 2 modules at the beginning of the 3rd party app) 
Load only one BBB module (i.e. load chat module or voice, etc)  in response to an event from a 3rd party application (mouse click, conf call button, etc) (Green: started, now we need to make sure that if clinets start to connect will be loading the right modules) 
Load more than one module at different times in response to events from the 3rd party application. Example, click to make a call (load voice module) and later click to start the video or click to start a presentation while calling. (Yellow: started and able to load chat and presentation within different tomes)

API Calls suggestions for format: 

Here is a simple diagram for the initial operation and information exchange for the API. But this will need to be improved as we go.

API general format: (my suggestion is to follow the format that Jeremy had used for now, unless you see otherwise, suggestions!)
