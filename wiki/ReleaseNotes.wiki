#summary Release Notes for new versions of !BigBlueButton.

= Release 0.62 =

Released: November XX, 2009

== New Features ==

  * Better Desktop Sharing! We've made our Desktop Sharing much better than it was before. We've implemented the Adobe Screen Codec and optimized for bandwidth. We now have the best desktop sharing on the block. Still platform independent, still no install required. Even friendlier user interface than before.

= Release 0.61: Titan =

Released: September 15, 2009

_Code named in honor of Saturn's largest moon_

== New Features ==

In preparation for schools and universities that are using !BigBlueButton for the fall term, this month saw a lot of bug fixes, hardening, and a few new features.  Our goal was (and continues to be) to make the !BigBlueButton code base as solid as possible.  Notable additions to this release include:

  * *Support for High Res Web Cameras* - As presenter, if you have the bandwidth, it's now possible to share video using your webcam at 640x480 high resolution or 320x240 standard resolution.  We've refactored the video module itself so the code is much cleaner and better organized.

  * *Simplified Desktop Sharing User Interface* - We've simplified the user experiences for initiating desktop sharing.  It now shares the entire desktop by default.  We've also refactored the desktop sharing module.

  * *Refactored slide conversion* - We went deep into the slide conversion process and fixed a number of bugs. 

  * *Desktop Sharing and Xuggler * - The sharing capture applet now divides the presenter's screen into distinct tiles and only sends to the server the tiles that have changed since the last frame.  The desktop sharing also uses Xuggler re-assemble the tiles and compress the images into a flash video stream.  Because desktop sharing incorporates Xuggler, which is licensed under the AGPL, we've had to make desktop sharing a separate module (don't worry, you can install it with a single command). 
However, if you choose to incorporate desktop sharing into !BigBlueButton, you must accept the AGPL license for !BigBlueButton. This has similar implications for any web application that, in turn, incorporates !BigBlueButton.
For information on installing desktop sharing in !BigBlueButton and how it changes the licensing, please see [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/InstallingDesktopSharing how to install desktop sharing].


== To upgrade your installation ==

If you are running a !BigBlueButton VM or had installed !BigBlueButton using packages, you can upgrade to this release with the following two commands

{{{
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get upgrade
}}}

*Note:* If you get an error during upgrade, just run `sudo apt-get upgrade` again.  We refactored the install scripts and a previous install script and new install scrip both reference the same configuration file.  Running the upgrade command a second time will solve the problem as the first time upgrades all the install script.

Participants can now use their headset to join a voice conference using voice over IP (VoIP).  For sites that setup !BigBlueButton to connect to the phone system, both VoIP and dial-in participants can share the same voice conference.

= 0.5 Release: Apollo 11 =

Released: July 21, 2009

_Code named in honor of the 40th anniversary of the moon landing_

=== New Features ===
* Desktop Sharing *

Desktop Sharing has been in development for a long time.  We wanted a solution that would work on all three platforms (Mac, Unix, and PC), so we decided to use a Java Applet to grab to send screen updates to the Red5 server.  We then used Xuggler from within Red5 to create a live stream from the incoming images from the applet.

From the presenter's perspective, there is a new screen icon on the top toolbar. Once clicked, the presenter can choose the area of their screen to share.  Clicking on Start Sharing causes this area of their screen to appear on all the clients.  While sharing the presenter can still drag around the window to determine which portion of the screen gets shared.

* Private Chat *

Any participant can now chat privately with anyone else in the room by choosing their name from the drop-down menu in the chat window.

Under the hood, the private chat works in the same way as the public chat, except that each participant has a dedicated shared object on the server to which messages get sent, and to which only they listen to.
