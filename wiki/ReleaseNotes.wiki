#summary Release Notes for new versions of BigBlueButton.

= 0.5 Release: Apollo 11 =

_Code named in honor of the 40th anniversary of the moon landing_

=== New Features ===
* Desktop Sharing *

Desktop Sharing has been in development for a long time.  We wanted a solution that would work on all three platforms (Mac, Unix, and PC), so we decided to use a Java Applet to grab to send screen updates to the Red5 server.  We then used Xuggler from within Red5 to create a live stream from the incoming images from the applet.

From the presenter's perspective, there is a new screen icon on the top toolbar. Once clicked, the presenter can choose the area of their screen to share.  Clicking on Start Sharing causes this area of their screen to appear on all the clients.  While sharing the presenter can still drag around the window to determine which portion of the screen gets shared.

* Private Chat *

Any participant can now chat privately with anyone else in the room by choosing their name from the drop-down menu in the chat window.

Under the hood, the private chat works in the same way as the public chat, except that each participant has a dedicated shared object on the server to which messages get sent, and to which only they listen to.
