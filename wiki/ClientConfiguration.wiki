#summary Configuring bbb-client.

= Introduction =
A detailed discussion of the client's config.xml file. This document shows you how to configure the client to work to your liking, and what options are available.

== Config.xml ==
The config.xml file is located in the deployed client directory, default location /var/www/bigbluebutton/client/conf.config.xml. If you are working with the source code, it is located in the client's src/conf directory, default location /home/firstuser/dev/source/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client/src/conf/config.xml.

Open up the config.xml file. This is a line by line discussion of it's properties, applicable for version 0.71.

== Main parameters ==
{{{
<localeversion>0.71</localeversion>
}}} This should be left as is. It has to do with the client caching localization files.
