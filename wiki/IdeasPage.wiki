Convert the Chat module to work with XMPP. This would enable people to log into bigbluebutton chat with their favorite XMPP compatible chat client, such as !OpenFire, GTalk, Pidgin, etc...

A bridge from Chat to IRC. This could be done in conjunction with the XMPP idea, as there are already some XMPP to IRC solutions.
