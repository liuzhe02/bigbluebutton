=*NOTE: We are editing this for the 0.7 release. Things may not work if you have an old (064) VM*=

= Setting up a !BigBlueButton Development Environment =
We run a custom Linux VM (using VMWare player or [http://www.virtualbox.org/ VirtualBox]) that has all the development environment setup.  We evolved our process to create a !BigBlueButton VM that is (a) a fully functional implementation of !BigBlueButton _and_ (b) a complete development environment.  Not only did we save ourselves a lot of effort, but we can offer you the same environment we use to develop !BigBlueButton.  

The !BigBlueButton VM runs Ubuntu 10.04.  Of course, you may not be developing using Ubuntu, nor may you want to run the VM.  In that case, the VM provides you with a working, reference implementation; by looking through the configuration (and using the docs below), you should be able to configure your own development environment on the Unix OS of your choice. Our approach is to use Windows for running Eclipse and Flash Builder, but the files are written to a !BigBlueButton VM (via a Samba network share). 

== Getting Started ==
First, [BigBlueButtonVM setup a BigBlueButtonVM] if you have not already done so.  If you are totally new to !BigBlueButton, you should read the [ArchitectureOverview Architecture Overview].  Doing so will make the following instructions much easier to understand.

Briefly, there are three main components to !BigBlueButton.  Each component has it's own runtime environment and, correspondingly, each is built using different tools.

  * bigbluebutton-web, referred as _bbb-web_, contains the [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/API API]
  * bigbluebutton-client, referred to as _bbb-client_, is the real-time Flash client.  This component is written in !ActionScript3 using the Flex framework.
  * bigbluebutton-apps, referred to as _bbb-apps_, is the collection of red5 webapps that provides the synchronization logic for the bbb-client.  This component is written in Java, though parts of it are written in JVM compatible languages [http://groovy.codehaus.org/ Groovy] and [http://www.scala-lang.org/ Scala].

== Setting up access to the VM from windows ==
*Skip this section if you are developing completely on Unix*
From your Windows environment, you'll want to access the !BigBlueButton source code that resides on your VM.  To do this, login to the VM as `firstuser` and issue the following command

{{{
  bbb-conf --setup-samba
}}}

This script will share the `/home/firstuser/dev` on your VM so you can access it from within Windows.  Some editors (such as Eclipse) can only access drives (not network shares).  To map this network share to a windows drive (e.g. V:), open Windows Explorer, hit the Alt key, and choose the menu command Tolls -> Map Network Drive. For the path, enter `\\<ip>\firstuser`, where '<ip>' is the local address of your VM.

See the [BBBConf] page for troubleshooting tips.

= How to make simple changes to !BigBlueButton =
We will start by making a simple change to the !BigBlueButton Flash client (bbb-client).  

Note: If you want to jump right into setting up a complete environment, we recommend going through at least one of the examples below before skipping ahead to the next section on "Setup a Full Development Environment"

Let's begin.  

== Checking out the source code ==
Type the following command to checkout !BigBlueButton from our [http://www.github.com/bigbluebutton github repository].
{{{
   bbb-conf --checkout
}}}

This will checkout into {{{/home/firstuser/dev/source/bigbluebutton}}}. By default, you will be working on the {{{master}}} (trunk) branch. 

To work on stable releases, list the available {{{tags}}} with

{{{
   git tag
}}}

To switch to a {{{tag}}}, type
{{{
   git checkout <tag>        (e.g. git checkout v0.7)
}}}

If you want to learn more about Git, read the book [http://progit.org/book/ Pro Git] especially chapters 1, 2, 3, 5. [http://help.github.com/ GitHub help] has a lot of information too.

== Setting up the development environment for !BigBlueButton Flex client: bbb-client ==
Now that you have checked-out the source, let's start making changes.

To setup a development environment for bbb-client, enter the following command

{{{
  bbb-conf --setup-dev client
}}}

This will setup some directories and modify nginx config to use your development client.

Everything is now setup to compile bbb-client.

{{{
  cd ~/dev/source/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client
  # Build everything. This may take a while as it deletes everything and rebuilds everything.
  ant

  # If you are only changing locales, do
  ant localization

  # If you are changing the modules. This will compile the modules but not the locales.
  ant build-bbb

Or, you can do

  ant clean
  ant localization
  ant build-bbb

which is equivalent to

  ant

  
}}}

{{{ant localization}}} which builds language swf files from provided txt files.

{{{ant build-bbb}}} uses the mxmlc compiler to rebuild the client from source. The resulting client is stored into `~/dev/source/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client/bin`.  If the IP address for your !BigBlueButtom VM is 192.168.0.182, you should be able to browse to http://192.168.0.182/, login to the web interface, and see your new client load.  

Okay, at this point it looks the same.  (Actually, it may look different because you are building from trunk, which likely will have changes from a release version).  Behind the scenes, nginx is loading the client from `~/dev/source/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client/bin`.  

Let's dive in and make a change. We'll change the default position of the presentation window. This property is stored in the file "!PresentationWindow.mxml". To make the change, we'll do the following:
 # *Locate the file:* The 'find' command should return the path of !PresentationWindow.mxml. If you're using the development VM, the path should be {{{./src/org/bigbluebutton/modules/present/views/PresentationWindow.mxml}}}
{{{
find . -name "PresentationWindow.mxml"
}}}
 # *Change the window position:* For this example, we'll change the upload presentation text in the presentation window.
{{{
# On ~ line 543, change the text= line
<mx:AddChild relativeTo="{spacer1}" position="before">
                <mx:Label id="uploadPresentationLabel" visible="true" width="100%"
                                text="{ResourceUtil.getInstance().getString('bbb.presentation.clickToUpload')}"/>
            </mx:AddChild>


# Add "now!" to text=, like so
<mx:AddChild relativeTo="{spacer1}" position="before">
                <mx:Label id="uploadPresentationLabel" visible="true" width="100%"
                                text="{ResourceUtil.getInstance().getString('bbb.presentation.clickToUpload')} now!"/>
            </mx:AddChild>

}}}

When you're done making you changes, go to the bbb-client directory and rebuild it.
{{{
   cd ~/dev/source/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client
   ant build-bbb
}}}

Now open your web browser, login to !BigBlueButton, and launch the client.  You should see the change in the presentation window, as in the following screenshot.

To revert back to the bbb-client installed from packages, edit `/etc/nginx/sites-available/bigbluebutton` and make the entry for `/client' match the following.

{{{
        location /client {
                root    /var/www/bigbluebutton;
                index  index.html index.htm;
        }
}}}

Then restart nginx.

{{{
   /etc/init.d/nginx restart
}}}

=== Setting up Flash Builder to work with the client ===
If you would like to develop the client using Flash Builder, you can follow these steps:
  * Install Flash Builder on your Windows/Mac machine.
  * Setup samba on the VM and mount the VM drive as described earlier in this document.
  * In Flash Builder, import the project by going to File->Import->Flash Builder Project.
    * The choose Import Project From
    * For project location, choose the bigbluebutton-client directory in your VM. For example W:\dev\source\bigbluebutton\bigbluebutton-client
    * Click next, and in the output folder, instead of 'bin-debug', put 'bin'
    * Click finish. It may take several minutes for this operation to complete, be patient.
  * Once this is done, right click on the project, go to properties>Flex Modules. Add these files to the modules list:
    * src/!ChatModule.mxml
    * src/!DeskShareModule.mxml
    * src/!HighlighterModule.mxml
    * src/!ListenersModule.mxml
    * src/!PhoneModule.mxml
    * src/!PresentModule.mxml
    * src/!VideoconfModule.mxml
    * src/!ViewersModule.mxml
  * Change all the IP addresses in src/conf/config.xml to point to your VM IP address
  * Right click on src/BigBlueButton.mxml and click on Set As Default Application. Then delete the Main.mxml file.
  * Compile the client in Flash Builder, then open the client in your browser by going to the VM IP. The client running there should now be the client in your Flash Builder environment.

This approach is limited in the sense that you can't use the Run button within Flash Builder to launch the client. You also can't use the Flex debugger. To be able to launch the client from Flash Builder, do the following:

  * On your VM, do:
{{{
sudo su root
cd /var/bigbluebutton
mkdir conference-mock-default
cd conference-mock-default
mkdir room-mock-default
chown -R tomcat6.tomcat6 /var/bigbluebutton/conference-mock-default
exit
}}}
  * On the client code, to src/conf/config.xml and change the 'host' property of the ViewersModule to point to "conf/join-mock.xml". Then open join-mock.xml and make sure the conference property is "conference-mock-default" and the room property is "room-mock-default"
  * You should now be able to launch from Flash Builder using the Run/Debug button.

== Setting up the development environment for !BigBlueButton web interface: bbb-web ==

The !BigBlueButton web interface is written in grails, so the development environment different from building the bbb-client.  As before, the first step is to use `bbb-conf` to setup the environment.

{{{
  bbb-conf --setup-dev web
}}}


This script does the following steps:

  # set your local IP address into  `~/.grails/bigbluebutton-config.properties`
  # make all files in `/var/bigbluebutton` writable by everyone

The first step sets up a global property for grails so it knows the IP address of your server when it runs.  The second step opens the permissions to slides directory so `firstuser` can upload a presentation.

Note: If you get an error upload slides when running bbb-web as `firstuser`, run the command `sudo chmod -R ugo+rwx /var/bigbluebutton`.

Before you can compile and run your version of bbb-web, you need to stop tomcat.  

{{{
  sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat6 stop
}}}

Next, let's compile and run bbb-web

{{{
  cd ~/dev/source/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-web
  ant
}}}

The default task for ant here is to make sure your libraries are up-to-date (using ivy), then execute the command `grails run-app`.  This will output the console to the command line, making it easier for you to see any exceptions through by grails.  To stop the grails server, just hit CTRL-C.

If you want to revert back to the web interface installed by the package bbb-web, stop grails and restart the tomcat6 server.

{{{
  sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat6 start
}}}

*Note:* After starting the tomcat server try to join a conference. If you receive the message "The page you are looking for is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later.", then the grails server could still be running and not tomcat. Enter the following command

{{{
    bbb-conf -c
}}}

If the issue is listed under the Potential Problems heading then to resolve the issue enter

{{{
   ps -aef | grep grails
}}}

This will list the grails process. Determine its pid (process id) and kill it. Then start the tomcat server. If the pid was 5012, enter the following commands.

{{{
   sudo kill -9 5012
   sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat6 start
}}}


*Note:* In !BigBlueButton 0.63, we are depreciating the grails interface.  If you want to create a front-end to !BigBlueButton, use the !BigBlueButton API.  See examples at [http://demo.bigbluebutton.org/bigbluebutton/demo/demo1.jsp Demo Apps].

== Setting up the development environment for !BigBlueButton red5 webapp: bbb-apps ==

The !BigBlueButton web apps runs within the red5 server.  Unlike development with bbb-web and bbb-client, where we could leave the packaged versions installed, because there is only one red5 server on the VM, we need to remove the existing bbb-apps first.  (Don't worry, you can easily restore it as shown at the end of this section).

To setup a development environment for bbb-apps, enter the following command

{{{
  bbb-conf --setup-dev apps
}}}

This will 

  # Enable write access to `/usr/share/red5/webapps`
  # Uninstall the existing `bbb-apps` package
  # Creates a `~/.bbb-apps-build.properties` file that sets the property `red5.home = /usr/share/red5`

Uninstalling the existing `bbb-apps` package will stop the red5 server, remove the directory `/usr/share/red5/webapps/bigbluebutton`, and restart red5.

At this point red5 is still running.  Before we deploy the local version of bbb-apps, let's stop the red5 server.  Open a new terminal window (if you are on windows, we recommend installing [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/ putty]) and enter the command. 

{{{
    sudo /etc/init.d/red5 stop
}}}

We'll come back to this separate terminal window in a moment.  Now, let's build and deploy the local copy of bbb-apps.

{{{
    cd ~/dev/source/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-apps/
    gradle war deploy
}}}

At this point, the ant script has copied the local build of bbb-apps to `/usr/share/red5/webapps/bigbluebutton`.  Now switch back to the second terminal window and enter the following command:

{{{
    cd /usr/share/red5
    sudo -u red5 ./red5.sh
}}}

You'll now see all the output from red5 directly at the console.  Like running the grails server at the command line, running red5 from the command line gives you easy visibility to any errors or exceptions.

If you want to revert back to the packaged version of !BigBlueButton apps, do the following

{{{
    rm -rf /usr/share/red5/webapps/bigbluebutton
    sudo apt-get install bbb-apps
    sudo /etc/init.d/red5 start
}}}

= Other Notes on setting up a Full Development Environment =

== Pre-requisites ==
In this environment, we assume you are developing on Windows with Eclipse and Flash Builder. Also, you have the BigBlueButton VM running on [http://www.vmware.com/ VMware]/[http://www.virtualbox.org/ VirtualBox] and mapped to a drive in your windows machine (see Setting up access to the VM from windows above).

On Windows:
 * Install Eclipse
 * Install the [http://www.scala-ide.org/ Scala Eclipse plugin]
 * Install the [http://groovy.codehaus.org/Eclipse+Plugin Groovy Eclipse plugin]
 * Install Flash Builder
 * Install JDK 6 and add JAVA_HOME in your environment variables
 * Install Grails 1.1.1 and add GRAILS_HOME in your environment variables

=== Client ===
 * See the *Setting up Flash Builder to work with the client* heading above.

=== BBB Commons ===
The bbb-commons contain classes that are common to bbb-web and bbb-apps.
 
{{{
  cd ~/dev/source/git/bigbluebutton/bbb-common-message

  # Generate Eclipse project files
  gradle eclipse

  # Import to your Eclipse by File->New->Java Project and then choose Create project from existing source pointing to your ~/dev/source/git/bigbluebutton/bbb-common-message

  # Setup the build path. Right-click on the project, chose Build Path->Configure Build Path
  # Click on the Source tab and add folder src/main/java

  # compile the classes
  gradle jar  

  # copy the jar file to /home/firstuser/dev/repo
  gradle uploadArchives 
}}}

=== BBB Web ===

{{{
  cd ~/dev/source/git/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-web

  # BBB web depends on bbb-commons,  
  # download all dependencies specifically bbb-commons from /home/firstuser/dev/repo
  gradle copyToLib 

  # Import to your Eclipse by File->New->Java Project and then choose Create project from existing source pointing to your {{{~/dev/source/git/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-web}}}
  
  # start bbb-web
  ant 
}}}

NOTE: If you encounter an error with the webapp redirecting to an invalid client, open the file grails-app/conf/bigbluebutton.properties and edit the line bigbluebutton.web.serverURL to point to the url of your machine.

=== BBB apps ===


{{{
  cd ~/dev/source/git/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-apps
  
  # Generate Eclipse project files
  gradle eclipse

  # download all dependencies specifically bbb-commons from /home/firstuser/dev/repo
  gradle copyToLib

  # Import to your Eclipse by File->New->Java Project and then choose Create project from existing source pointing to your ~/dev/source/git/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-apps

  # Right-click on the project and add Scala Nature and Groovy Nature
  
  # Setup your build path and library

  # builds the application
  gradle war

  # deploys the application to Red5 (/usr/share/red5/webapps)
  gradle deploy
}}}

=== Video app ===
 * Import to your Eclipse by File->New->Java Project and then choose Create project from existing source pointing to your {{{~/dev/source/git/bigbluebutton/bbb-video}}}

{{{
  cd ~/dev/source/git/bigbluebutton/bbb-video
  
  # download all dependencies
  ant resolve

  # build the application
  ant dist

  # deploy the application to Red5 (/usr/share/red5/webapps)
  ant deploy
}}}

=== Voice app ===
 * Import to your Eclipse by File->New->Java Project and then choose Create project from existing source pointing to your {{{~/dev/source/git/bigbluebutton/bbb-voice}}}

{{{
  cd ~/dev/source/git/bigbluebutton/bbb-video
  
  # download all dependencies 
  gradle copyToLib

  # build the application
  gradle war

  # deploy the application to Red5 (/usr/share/red5/webapps)
  gradle deploy
}}}

=== Desktop Sharing app ===
 * Import to your Eclipse by File->New->Java Project and then choose Create project from existing source pointing to your {{{~/dev/source/git/bigbluebutton/deskshare}}}

{{{
  cd ~/dev/source/git/bigbluebutton/deskshare
  
  # download all dependencies 
  gradle copyToLib

  # build the server component
  cd app

  # builds the application
  gradle war

  # deploy the application to Red5 (/usr/share/red5/webapps)
  gradle deploy

  # To build the applet
  cd applet

  gradle jar

  # sign the applet
  ant sign-jar

  # copy deskshare/applet/build/libs/bbb-deskshare-applet-0.64.jar to ~/dev/source/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client/resources
  cp ~/dev/source/git/bigbluebutton/deskshare/applet/build/libs/bbb-deskshare-applet-0.64.jar ~/dev/source/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client/resources

  # compile the bbb-client (see Developing with bbb client)
}}}

== TIPS ==
* Run bbb-conf --check *
Run {{{bbb-conf --check}}} to see if there are any potential problems.

* Running Red5 *

It is better to have multiple ssh windows when developing. On one window, you can start and stop Red5.
{{{
   # Stop Red5
   sudo /etc/init.d/red5 stop

   # cd to Red5 directory
   cd /usr/share/red5

   # Start Red5 as red5 user
   sudo -u red5 ./red5.sh

}}}

On another window, you can make your code changes and deploy to Red5, e.g.
{{{
  cd ~/dev/source/git/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-apps
  
  # make some changes
  
  # Build
  gradle war

  # Deploy 
  gradle deploy

}}}


*Remove BBB packages*

List the BBB packages by typing
{{{
dpkg -l | grep bbb
}}}

which results:
{{{
