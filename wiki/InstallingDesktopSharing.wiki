#summary Installing Desktop Sharing

= Desktop sharing is now a separate component =
As of !BigBlueButton 0.61, the desktop sharing module for !BigBlueButton (bbb-apps-deskshare) now uses Xuggler, an excellent Java wrapper to ffmpeg.  We think pretty highly of the [http://www.xuggle.com/xuggler/ Xuggler] team and their work has helped us offer a great open source desktop sharing module for BigBlueButton.

However, use of Xuggler brings a change to !BigBlueButton.  Xuggler is licensed under the [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html GNU Affero General Public License] (AGPL).  Because bbb-apps-deskshare links with Xuggler, bbb-apps-deskshare is licensed under AGPL. 

To keep !BigBlueButton licensed under LGPL, we've removed it from the [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/InstallationUbuntu install scripts for Ubuntu] and from the [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/BigBlueButtonVM BigBlueButton virtual machine].  Don't worry, you can install it with a single command

{{{
apt-get install bbb-apps-deskshare
}}}

HOWEVER, if you choose to install bbb-apps-deskshare into BigBlueButton, !BigBlueButton itself now becomes licensed under AGPL.  This means you must make available the source for any web application that, in turn, incorporates BigBlueButton into it, even if that application is running on a hosted environment and is not distributed.   

For the vast majority of our users, especially in the education market, this is a non-issue.  We all live and benefit from an open source world.

However, if you don't want agree to the terms of the AGPL license for !BigBlueButton and any application that you incorporate BigBlueButton into, you have two options:

1. Remove the deskshare component using the following command 

{{{
sudo apt-get remove bbb-apps-deskshare
}}} 

and !BigBlueButton reverts to the GNU Limited General Public License (LGPL)

2. E-mail us (ffdixon at bigbluebutton dot org) for information on how to obtain a commerical license for bbb-apps-deskshare and Xuggler that is not AGPL, which removes the requirements for you to share the code to any application that incorporates BigBlueButton.

By purchasing a commercial license for desktop sharing, and you will also be supporting the improvements in two open source projects -- BigBlueButton and Xuggler -- that continue to provide your users with many benefits for years to come.
