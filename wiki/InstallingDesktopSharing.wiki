#summary Installing Desktop Sharing

= Introduction =

The desktop sharing module for BigBlueButton (bbb-apps-deskshare) now uses Xuggler, a Java wrapper to ffmpeg, for encoding the images it receives from the client.  We think pretty highly of the [http://www.xuggle.com/xuggler/ Xuggler] team and their work has saved us a lot of effort.

The use of Xuggler brings a change to BigBlueButton.  Xuggler is licensed under the [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html GNU Affero General Public License] (AGPL).  Because bbb-apps-deskshare links with Xuggler, bbb-apps-deskshare is licensed under AGPL. 

To keep BigBlueButton under LGPL, we've removed it from the default install from the virtual machine.  Don't worry, you can install it with a single command

{{{
apt-get install bbb-apps-deskshare
}}}

However, if you choose to install and link in bbb-apps-deskshare, because BigBlueButton now incorporates an AGPL module, BigBlueButton itself now becomes licensed under AGPL, and any extensions or enhancements you create must also be licensed under AGPL. 

For the vast majority of our users, especially in the education market, this is no problem.  They live in an open source world.

However, if you don't want agree to the terms of the AGPL license for BigBlueButton, you have options:


1. Remove the deskshare component using the following command 

{{{
sudo apt-get remove bbb-apps-deskshare
}}} and BigBlueButton reverts to the GNU Limited General Public License (LGPL)

2. [http://bigbluebutton.org/license E-mail us] for informaiton on obtaining a commerical license for bbb-apps-deskshare and Xuggler that is not AGPL.
