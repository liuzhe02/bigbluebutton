#summary Installing BigBlueButton from RPMs

= Introduction =

We have been experimenting recently with packaging BigBlueButton RPMs. The packages have been developed with and tested for CentOS 5.4 i386.


= Installation =

To install from RPMs, you can use one of two repositories:

 # *Stable Repository:* contains the latest stable release.
 # *Development Repository:* contains the latest build from trunk.

We have provided a script that you can run and it would take care of the installation for you, including adding required repositories.

== Installation from Stable Repository ==
The following commands will install BigBlueButton from the stable repository.
{{{
wget http://ec2-67-202-22-38.compute-1.amazonaws.com/centos/5.4/i386/stable/bbb-install.sh
chmod u+x bbb-install.sh
./bbb-install.sh
}}}

== Installation from Development Repository ==
The following commands will install BigBlueButton from the development repository.
{{{
wget http://ec2-67-202-22-38.compute-1.amazonaws.com/centos/5.4/i386/dev/bbb-install.sh
chmod u+x bbb-install.sh
./bbb-install.sh
}}}

= Installing Desktop Sharing =
Desktop sharing is not installed by default. To install desktop sharing, run the following commands:

{{{
yum install bbb-deskshare

# restart BigBlueButton
bbb-conf -clean
}}}

= Issues =
If you run BigBlueButton immediately after installation and it is not running properly. Try executing this command to restart BigBlueButton:
{{{
bbb-conf -clean
}}}
