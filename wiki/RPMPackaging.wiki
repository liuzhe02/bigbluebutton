#summary Installing BigBlueButton from RPMs

= Introduction =

This document describes how to use RPM packages to install BigBlueButton on *CentOS 5.4 i386 (32-bit)*.  The installation takes about fifteen minutes (depending on your internet connection).

*Note:* While are many RPM-based linux distributions available (32-bit and 64-bit), for the moment we focused our development and testing *CentOS 5.4 i386 (32-bit)*.

= How to Install BigBlueButton on CentOS 5.4 32-bit =

To install from RPMs, you can use our development repository, which contains the latest build from trunk.

To make it easy to install, we created a shell script that first adds all the required repositiories on CentOS, then installs BigBlueButton.

The following commands will install !BigBlueButton from the development repository.
{{{
wget http://ec2-67-202-22-38.compute-1.amazonaws.com/centos/5.4/i386/dev/bbb-install.sh
chmod u+x bbb-install.sh
./bbb-install.sh
bbb-conf --clean
}}}

The last command `bbb-conf --clean` does a clean restart of !BigBlueButton so all the processes get started in the right order.  !BigBlueButton will properly startup upon restart of the machine.

== What does bbb-install do? ==

The script bbb-install contains the following contents:

{{{

        if [ $EUID != 0 ]; then
                echo "Need to be root to run this option"

== How to install Desktop Sharing ==
Desktop sharing is not installed by default. To install desktop sharing, run the following command:

{{{
yum install bbb-apps-deskshare
}}}

Before you do, you need to read [http://bigbluebutton.org/license BigBlueButton License].


== Troubleshooting ==
If you run !BigBlueButton immediately after installation and it is not running properly. Try executing this command to restart !BigBlueButton:
{{{
bbb-conf -clean
}}}
