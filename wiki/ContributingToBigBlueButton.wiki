= Tests = 
Your changes should be accompanied by tests. We have setup some of the subsystems to use [http://testng.org/doc/index.html TestNG]. We will be also refactoring these subsystems and writing tests for them.

= Coding Conventions and Documentation =
For code written in Java, we will follow the [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconvtoc-136057.html Java Coding Convention] with minor changes. We will be documenting those changes in this wiki.

Methods, especially those classes that provides an API, should be documented  using the [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137868.html JavaDoc] format. This way we as part of running !Hudson CI, we will generate the docs.

For !Flex/!ActionScript code, follow the [http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/help.html?content=asdoc_1.html AsDoc] format.
